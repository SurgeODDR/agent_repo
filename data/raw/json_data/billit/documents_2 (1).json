This blog post lists all the things you need to be aware of. !( min !New Year, although it may be shorter or longer for legal entities. In the case of **natural persons** (self-employed in principal and secondary occupations), the new financial year always starts on **1 January**. In the case of **legal entities** (companies, not-for-profit associations, etc.), although it is customary to start the financial year on 1 January, it is not obligatory. So you could start your financial year at a different time of the year. If your financial year does start on 1 January, you should go through the **checklist** below at the end of the previous year or the start of the new one. If your fiscal year has a different start date, this list will still be helpful; the only difference is that you will have to go over it at a different time. ## 1.Check whether you still need to prepare and send invoices for 2024 You must send invoices for all your products and services within 15 days. While it is not a problem to prepare invoices in December, for example, for products or services you provided in November, keeping all records from the same year together is advisable. That way, **the profit calculation for your financial year will be correct**. Also read: Generating and sending invoices with Billit ## 2.Update the numbering of your invoices The following rules apply to invoice numbers: - Invoice numbers must consist of a **number sequence** or a **combination of numbers and letters**. - **Spaces** are not allowed (dashes are). - Each invoice number must **be unique** . - The invoice numbers should **be consecutive and sequential chronologically**. It is, therefore, perfectly acceptable for the numbering of your invoices to start with 1 and increase throughout the different years of operation. (Restarting is not allowed.) Nevertheless, many businesses find it easier to have their invoice numbers start with the year the invoices are sent. For example: - 20250001 - 20250002 - 20250003 - … If you choose that form, you will have to **adapt the numbering in Billit’s settings** at the start of the new year. Billit will then automatically generate consecutive invoice numbers for that year. Also read: Adjusting invoice numbering in Billit ## 3.Process all purchase invoices dated 2024 Do not wait too long to process and pay invoices for goods and services ordered by your company in 2024. Also read: Process purchase invoices in Billit ## 4.Cash up Your cash book is a **financial diary** that should be kept meticulously. It is where all incoming and outgoing cash movements are recorded. This should, in principle, **always be correct**, but especially at the end of the financial year, you would do well to (manually) count the money you have in cash and check whether it matches your cash book. Also read: Keeping a digital cash book in Billit ## 5. Update your daily cash receipts book Ensure all entries are accurate up to the end of the fiscal year. Do you keep your daily cash receipts book in Billit? Then December will automatically be closed as soon as you make an entry in the new fiscal year. Also read: Keeping a digital daily cash receipts book in Billit !Onderneemster Plantenwinkel ## 7.Check whether your terms and conditions are still current The new year is the perfect opportunity to consider whether you need to make changes to the general ‘standard contract’ between your company and your clients. ## 8.If necessary, adjust your periodic invoices If you automatically send periodic invoices via Billit, adjust the **amount** or **period** for the new year if necessary. You may also need to adjust the **standard text** (such as the year) on these invoices. You can also adjust the **period** if necessary. **Tip:** You can use dynamic parameters to automatically enter the correct date or period on your periodic invoices in Billit. Also read: Periodic invoices in Billit ### 9.If necessary, adjust the prices of your products You may start charging higher prices for certain products from 1 January (e.g. because of indexation). If so, be sure to update these prices in Billit as well. Also read: Add products in Billit ### 10.Start electronic invoicing via Peppol In many countries, electronic invoicing is becoming mandatory, but of course, you can start **e-invoicing** via Peppol before then. It’s easy with Billit. If you are not yet using Peppol to send your invoices, why not make a resolution to start doing so in your new financial year? You will see that it's straightforward. **Tip:** When you switch over, ask your suppliers to deliver your invoices digitally via Peppol as well. By the way, in Billit, under “Suppliers” you can see which of your suppliers are using Peppol and which are not (yet). !( Back to overview.

Other states are degraded and outage. Each of the _user facing_ services have two Service Level Indicators ( **SLI**): the **uptime**, and the **error rate**. The Uptime score is generally a measure of the service performance (latency). The Error rate measures the percentage of requests that fail due to an error (usually, a 5XX status code). A service is considered available when: - The Uptime of the service is above its Service Level Objective (SLO), - AND The error rate is below its Service Level Objective (SLO). An example of available web service; within a 5 minute period: - At least 90% of requests have a latency within their \"satisfactory\" threshold - AND, less than 0.5% of requests return a 5XX error status response. In other words, a service needs to simultaneously meet both of its SLO targets in order to be considered available. If either target is not met, the service is considered unavailable. The availability score for a service is then calculated as the percentage of time that it is available. The Availability score for each service combined define the platform Service Level Availability (SLA). The SLA number indicates availability of Billit.eu for a select period of time. For example, if service becomes unavailable for a 10 minute period, the availability score will be: - 99.90% for the week (10 070 minutes of availability out of 10 080 minutes in a week) - 99.97% for the month (43 190 minutes of availability out of 43 200 minutes in the month) The SLA score can be seen on the SLA dashboard, and the SLA target is set as an Infrastructure key performance indicator for the API (api.billit.be), Login (my.billit.be) and Application (my.billit.be) Billit guarantees 99.9% uptime, however our internal target is 100% !Billit cookies logo.

The Peppol network makes this possible with **evidence files**. This blog explains the difference with other return receipts, such as IMRs. Read on to find out … !( min !Peppol IMR have exactly the same function when sending documents via the Peppol network. They provide you with the evidence that your invoice was sent correctly and that you have therefore done everything necessary to deliver your invoice to your client. You will usually receive an evidence file a few seconds after sending your document via Peppol. However, there is a snag, because this does not mean that your document has also been actually delivered to your recipient. That is because you will receive an evidence file the instant your document has been correctly delivered to your recipient’s Peppol Access Point. Therefore, there may still be a technical problem when sending the document from that Access Point to your recipient’s invoicing software. However, in that case, the fault lies not with you, but with your recipient’s Peppol service provider. ### IMRs: client gives feedback An evidence file is therefore a purely technical message about the transmission of your document. It does not tell you whether your client will actually deal with your invoice. The Peppol network sends different types of messages for that purpose, namely **status messages**. A status message is officially called an **Invoice Message Response**, or **IMR** (sometimes also: Invoice Response). An IMR allow your recipient to give **detailed feedback** on your invoice in the form of various statuses. Therefore, it is your client who will trigger these messages by taking certain actions in their invoicing software. IMRs can display the following statuses: ·Message Acknowledgement - AB ·In Process – IP ·Accepted – AP ·Rejected – RE, with the reason for rejection, e.g. incorrect order number ·Under Query – UQ ·Conditionally Accepted – CA ·Paid – PD !Tablet Messageimr ENG. You will find these under **‘Messages’** under each sales invoice you have sent via Peppol. This shows you immediately when your invoice was sent correctly and whether your client is processing it. In the case of purchase invoices, Billit automatically sends the correct status depending on the actions you take (e.g. setting the invoice to ‘Paid’). Therefore, you won’t have to do anything else in Billit, provided the invoice sender has entered the receipt of these status messages in the Peppol address book. You can find more information on this in our help article about invoices. !( Back to overview.

    "markdown": "- +32 3 283 09 09 - Contact - !( Accountants]( Het Billit-facturatieplatform Ontdek de functies waarmee je in elke stap van je facturatieproces meteen tijd kan besparen. Lees meer - !( Uitgaven - !( Automatische verwerking Integraties en koppelingen - !( Integraties - !( Accountants - !( Uitgaven - !( Automatische verwerking Integraties en koppelingen - !( Integraties Sommige platformen zoals Billit koppel je bovendien moeiteloos aan de software van je boekhouder. Op het einde van het kwartaal kun je met een spreekwoordelijke druk op de knop je hele boekhouding digitaal bij je boekhouder afleveren. Papieren binnenbrengen, documenten mailen of met WeTransfer versturen, hoeft allemaal niet. Dat betekent minder werk en gedoe voor jou én voor je boekhouder (en dus minder kosten voor jou). ## 2. Minder kans op fouten Bij een elektronische factuur staat alle info op een vaste plaats in het document, waardoor het volledig automatisch uitgelezen kan worden door de ontvangende software van je klant. Doordat het facturatieproces elektronisch verloopt, verklein je ook de kans op menselijke fouten. Een e-factuur wordt opgesteld in UBL, Universal Business Language. Dat is een soort computertaal die het mogelijk maakt om de factuurdata van jouw boekhoudpakket naar het boekhoudpakket van je klant (en boekhouder) te sturen en te laten verwerken. Op die manier ben je zeker dat de klant altijd de correcte betaalgegevens krijgt (zoals rekeningnummer en bedrag), dat de data overeenstemmen met de data op je bestelbon en je leveringsnota, enzovoort. ## 3. Overzichtelijke facturen Een factuur opstellen doe je eenvoudig via de invulvelden waarmee je directe toegang hebt tot je klant- en productgegevens. Om een visuele weergave van je digitale factuur te maken volgt de software een vooraf ingestelde lay-out. Geen gedoe meer dus met eigen sjablonen die je moet ontwerpen en aanpassen in Word of Excel, tekst die je moet uitlijnen, tekstblokjes die verspringen, formules die je moet invoeren, … In enkele muisklikken is je factuur klaar om te versturen. ## 4. Steeds meer bedrijven gebruiken (en vragen om) e-facturen Het gebruik van elektronische facturen zit in de lift. Tegelijk zijn er veel overheden die dit promoten. Wie bijvoorbeeld aan de Vlaamse overheid factureert, moet verplicht een e-factuur gebruiken. Wellicht heb je ook al klanten die e-facturen gebruiken. Een ander voordeel: omdat ze minder verwerkingstijd vergen bij je klant, is de kans groter dat je facturen sneller betaald worden als je elektronisch factureert. Maar wat als je overschakelt op e-facturen en je klant er geen raad mee weet? Ook dat is geen probleem, want met een facturatieplatform zoals Billit kun je ook gewoon een pdf-versie van je factuur naar je klant sturen, en met je e-factuur wordt steeds een pdf-versie mee verstuurd. ## 5. Ook makkelijk voor je aankoopfacturen op papier of in pdf Gebruik je facturatiesoftware? Dan kun je facturen die je nog zelf op papier of in een pdf ontvangt, makkelijk omzetten in een digitaal document. Op die manier kun je ook niet-digitale documenten verwerken en bijhouden. De software leest de gegevens in en zet ze in de correcte velden. Het bestand (een pdf, een foto van de factuur, … ) laad je eenvoudig op. Als je een facturatieplatform zoals Billit gebruikt, kan je ook gewoon een foto maken en opladen via de app. ## 6. Veilig en vlot beschikbaar Voor het aanmaken en beheren van e-facturen hoef je vandaag geen software meer te downloaden. Voor sommige online facturatieplatforms zoals Billit volstaat een computer of tablet met internetverbinding. Het voordeel van zo’n SaaS-oplossing (Software as a Service) is bovendien dat de software altijd up-to-date is. Je hoeft niet om de 2 jaar een nieuwe versie aan te kopen of updates te installeren. Gebruik je een tekstverwerker of Excel om je facturen aan te maken en in een pdf te genereren, dan heb je dat gemak niet. Bij een online facturatieplatform worden je data ook veilig in de cloud bewaard en zijn de data dus altijd en overal beschikbaar. Nog een plus: crasht je computer of wordt je laptop gestolen? Dan heb je al je data nog. Bovendien zijn online facturatieplatforms vaak uitgerust met slimme algoritmes. Een voorbeeld? Als iemand een foutief IBAN heeft toegevoegd op een aankoopfactuur om onterecht het geld van de betaling op het rekeningnummer te ontvangen, dan ontvang je van Billit een waarschuwing. ## 7. Eén oplossing voor heel wat administratieve en boekhoudkundige taken Offertes, bestelbonnen, leveringsbonnen, facturen en creditnota’s: alles is aan elkaar gekoppeld in een facturatieplatform. Een offerte omzetten in een bestelbon, of een factuur omzetten in een creditnota? Dat doe je in enkele kliks. Geen gedoe met copy/paste en andere manuele aanpassingen. In tegenstelling tot een pdf kun je dankzij elektronische facturatie ook heel wat processen automatiseren (afhankelijk van de software die je gebruikt). Enkele voorbeelden: Dankzij de koppeling met de bank haal je de banktransacties van je zakelijke rekeningen binnen en worden je facturen automatisch afgepunt. Je kunt automatisch een herinnering laten versturen naar klanten met openstaande facturen voorbij de vervaldatum. Dankzij de talrijke integraties kun je QR-codes op je facturen zetten waarmee je klanten kunt laten betalen. Je koppelt moeiteloos verschillende CRM-softwarepakketten (Customer Relationship Management). Productcatalogussen of lijsten met klanten en leveranciers importeren? Geen probleem! !( Terug naar overzicht**.

As of 2026, this will also become the norm for transactions between taxable companies. Specifically, Belgian companies will have to use **structured electronic invoices** (GEFs), sent via the Peppol network. GEFs are digital files in XML (Extensible Markup Language) format, built according to a universal structure, the **Universal Business Language** or UBL. This structure ensures that software packages worldwide can read and process electronic invoices fully automatically. #### Why is electronic invoicing becoming mandatory? Invoices that are prepared, sent, received and processed completely digitally have numerous advantages. For example, many processes can be automated, leading to **time savings** and **administrative simplification** for companies and their accountants. For the government, electronic invoicing is above all a strong weapon in **the fight against VAT fraud**. This new preliminary draft is therefore part of the coalition agreement, which explicitly includes reducing the VAT gap. Before the draft bill on electronic invoicing can be voted on, the Council of State, the High Council for the Self-Employed and SMEs, Agrofront and ITAA must first give their advice. #### Electronic invoicing with Billit Those who choose Billit today are already completely ready for the future. With our billing software you can create and process invoices entirely electronically. Moreover, through Billit you have access to the Peppol network, which is the standard for sending and receiving e-invoices. Not using Billit yet?

On the basis of this definition, you might expect invoices in PDF format to be digital invoices. After all, they can be sent as e-mail attachments and stored on a computer or in the cloud. However, we refer to them only as **‘semi-digital invoices’**. This is because PDF files fall short in one important respect: the invoice data cannot be automatically transferred and processed in invoicing and accounting software. The details still have to be **entered manually**, e.g. by copying and pasting. Although digital processing of PDF invoices is possible, it is not as fast and easy as you would like. ### Types of digital invoices There are three types of digital invoices: ·**Scanned paper invoices** ·**Semi-digital invoices**, for example in PDF or Word format ·Structured Electronic Invoices (SEI), also called **e-invoices** The main difference between these types of digital invoices is in the ease with which they can be processed. In the case of scanned paper invoices, the data has to be retyped manually or Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software has to be used to recognise the data. For semi-digital invoices, you can use recognition software as well as copying and pasting, but you still have to check the data manually, and possibly complete and confirm it. Only SEls can be processed **fully automatically**. ### What are Structured Electronic Invoices? A Structured Electronic Invoice is a file in **XML format**, which is short for Extensible Markup Language. Such files are built according to a universal structure, the Universal Business Language or UBL. That structure allows software packages worldwide to read and process electronic invoices fully automatically. You can simply send Structured Electronic Invoices by e-mail or via the secure Peppol network. ### The advantages of Structured Electronic Invoices Structured Electronic Invoices and the software to manage them, such as **Billit**, have many advantages for you as a business owner: ·**Time savings**: Invoicing takes less time, and no manual steps are required during processing ·**Space savings**: Unlike paper invoices, e-invoices do not take up physical space ·**Less chance of human errors**: No more manual data entry and transaction processing required ·**Easily searchable**: Your invoicing software’s search engine lets you find the right invoice in a jiffy ·**Faster payments:** Link invoices to a payment system via a payment button or QR code ·Automated payments processing: A link to your bank allows immediate recognition of outstanding invoices ·**Insight into your finances:** Your invoicing software gives an overview of useful financial data and lets you carry out analyses ·Smooth communication with your accountant: The link between the invoicing software and accounting software lets your accountant process your invoices smoothly and monitor your figures continuously Also read: Seven advantages of electronic invoicing ### E-invoices: Mandatory in some cases In many European countries, suppliers of goods or services to **public authorities** are already **required** to issue Structured Electronic Invoices. This is the case in the Netherlands and Belgium (both federal and in Flanders), but also in France, Luxembourg and many other European countries. Italy goes a step further: there, Structured Electronic Invoices are actually mandatory for all B2B transactions. !( Back to overview.

In this article you will discover what Chorus Pro is. What do you need to know about this solution? !( min !Op Weg Naar Digitaal Factureren. Wat Is Chorus Pro. New legislation extends the mandate for electronic invoicing in France to all companies, including all B2B transactions between 2024 and 2026. Therefore, any (French) company subject to VAT and maintaining B2B relationships will be required to use electronic invoicing with Chorus Pro from 2024. ## Broad functionality Chorus Pro provides several capabilities, including managing and sending electronic invoices, managing billing data, tracking billing status and facilitating payments. The system also supports integration with other business applications, such as accounting software. ## In practice So how do you send your invoice to the Chorus Pro platform? That's easy! Because Billit has its own certified Peppol Access Point, it is very simple to send invoices to a government agency. You first add the French government as a customer in the Billit software and use three identifiers: the VAT number, SIRET number and a specific routing code to determine the appropriate government department. Then you create a sales invoice for that customer and choose \"Send via Peppol\". That way you can send your first invoice in minutes. !( Back to overview.

For monthly VAT returns, nothing changes and the deadlines will still be the 20th. Once the statutory filing deadline has passed, it will **no longer possible to file a corrective periodic VAT return**. However, you will be able to make corrections in the next return. These rules take effect from **1 January 2025**. ### 2. Deadline for answering a request for information From 2025, if the VAT administration asks you for more information in writing, you must **respond within one month** as standard, or **within 10 days in specific cases** (such as an impending time limit or bankruptcy). ### 3. Proposal for a replacement return If you do not file your VAT return on time, you will automatically be issued a **‘proposal for a replacement VAT return’**. Please note that could be higher than the actual VAT due. You will **still be able to file a VAT return within a month**, although you will still be fined. After that month, you can only **lodge an objection**. ### 4. Adjusted fines From 1 January 2025, fines are being adjusted for: - Late filing of your VAT return: 100 euros per month of delay, with a maximum of 500 euros. - Failure to file your VAT return: 500 to 5,000 euros per offence. - Failure to pay your VAT due: 5 to 15% of the amount due ### 5. VAT provision account and new refund rules From 2025, VAT credits related to your return itself can only be requested through that return. The ‘accumulated’ credit from previous returns will be credited to your **provision account**, which is replacing the former VAT current account, and you must reclaim it via MyMinfin. This also means that if you file monthly returns, you will usually receive your VAT refund sooner, as **monthly refunds** will become the general rule. The new rules on VAT refunds will take effect from **1 February 2025**. Your current account will remain accessible until **1 May 2025**, and you will still be able to access your credit there. After that, the VAT credit management will go through the provision account. ### 6. New account numbers and direct debit The account numbers for VAT payments are changing. From 2025, you will have to pay to account number BE41 6792 0036 4210 or BE42 6792 0000 0054, depending on the nature of the payment. **From 2026,** you will also be able to pay VAT to FPS Finance by **direct debit**. ## More info on the new VAT chain You can read more about all the changes in FPS Finance’s brochure ‘The renewed VAT chain’. ## What does this mean for Billit users? We have already updated the quarterly return deadlines in the Billit platform. If you use Billit for your quarterly VAT returns, you will already **see the correct deadlines** on the platform.

In this article we zoom in on the basic principles of the Mercurius platform. What do you need to know about this? !( min !Op Weg Naar Digitaal Factureren Wat Is Mercurius. - Mercurius puts the e-invoice in the mailbox of the customer. - The customer retrieves their e-invoices at their own pace. - he customer processes the e-invoice. - The customer prepares a response to the e-invoice and sends it to Mercurius. - Mercurius sends the response to the supplier (via the Peppol network, via an email or to be consulted via a portal site). ## How do you send an e-invoice to the Mercurius platform?

Nowadays, QR codes are used in many sectors. You find them on posters, menus, business cards, invoices and much more. ### How do QR codes work? A QR code is a complex matrix of black and white squares called ‘modules’, into which letters, figures and other characters can be coded. The image consists of **different patterns** that each fulfil a specific function. For example, there are patterns for orienting the image, determining its size and specifying the version of the QR code, etc. Today, you can easily scan a QR code with a **smartphone** camera. An inbuilt QR reader or one you have downloaded then converts the image into an URL, text or series of digits. ### What different kinds of QR code exist? We can distinguish the following types of QR code: | Type | Example | Description | | --- | --- | --- | | Model 1 | !Qr Code Model 1 Small. | | Model 2 | !Qr Code Model 2 Small and is used for **SEPA credit transfers** (SCT). After scanning an EPC QR code with your banking app, you will see a **completed bank transfer form** that you can execute immediately. The code is used in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and Finland. EPC QR codes are supported by the banks Argenta, ASN, Belfius, Bunq, BNP Paribas Fortis, ING, KBC, Knab, SNS and VDK. In Billit, EPC QR codes are placed on your invoices by default – as long as you have _not_ activated the link with Payconiq or Mollie. This QR code makes it easier for your customers to pay your invoices. You can use EPC QR codes to **pay invoices yourself** as well. To do so, select one or more invoices, click ‘Pay’ and select the QR icon. You can now scan the QR code with your banking app to pay the invoice. Read the help article: Paying invoices in Billit #### 2.Payconiq QR code If you activate the Payconiq integration\"), you can put a **Payconiq QR code** on your invoice. Then your customers can pay your invoice by scanning the code with the Payconiq by Bancontact app (or their own banking app, if the app has Payconiq by Bancontact integrated into it). To be able to activate the integration, your business does need to be a Payconiq customer. Read the help article: Linking Billit to Payconiq #### 3.Mollie QR code If you activate the Mollie integration\"), you can put a **Mollie QR code** on your invoice. When your customers scan that QR code on your invoice, they are taken to a **payment page** where they can pay your invoice with a payment method of their choice. So, the QR code cannot be scanned with a banking app: instead it links to a payment page. On that page, your customers can choose between various payment methods such as Mastercard, Visa and Bancontact. To be able to use the integration with Mollie, your business does need to be a Mollie customer. Read the help article: Linking Billit to Mollie #### 4.

In fact, it is in charge of regulating and controlling the flow of e-invoices. Mexico, like many other countries, uses its own standard for e-invoicing, which is the **CFDI format** (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet). You have to get every e-invoice you issue in CDFI format validated – in other words, digitally stamped – by the SAT. This digital stamp guarantees invoice authenticity and prevents fraud. You are then free to choose how you send your invoice, which may be by e-mail, or you can print the e-invoice and send it by post. Mexican companies have an obligation to store copies of their CFDIs for possible audits by the tax authorities. ### How to send digital invoices to Mexico The Mexican e-invoicing system may seem rather complex, but Billit makes it very easy for you. All you need to do is connect Billit to SAT, after which you can create e-invoices in the usual way. Before sending an invoice, you can **digitally sign it and have it stamped with a single mouse click**. Our ' E-invoicing in Mexico' page provides a clear step-by-step plan.

Some accounting software also allows you to invoice, but the features are usually very limited. Accounting software should not be confused with office management software for accountants, which is software designed to simplify and automate the internal organization of accounting firms. Larger companies with in-house accounting services use both invoicing software and accounting software. Sole traders and small businesses tend to work with external accountants. An external bookkeeper’s or accountant’s software can be linked to the business’s invoicing software. Accounting software and invoicing software are now all cloud-based, offering integrations for platforms to communicate with each other. For example, Billit allows you to link not only with your accountant’s software but also with your webshop, bank, CRM system, etc. #### What are CRM and ERP? Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is all about managing interactions with (potential) customers. CRM software consists of contact management and sales management tools – software that helps improve business relationships. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is about integrating and automating administrative, financial, commercial and logistics processes in a single software solution: the ERP system. !( Back to overview.

These days, Peppol is a strong international brand, used by businesses as well as public authorities – and not only in Europe, but also far beyond. What do you need to know about this network? !( min !Offiicial Peppol Acces Point 656X300 to mutually exchange electronic invoices using different formats and following a particular protocol. You might think of this network as a kind of “telephone network for invoices”. All you need to send your recipient a message is their unique **Peppol ID**. That ID is similar to a phone number. Even if your recipient switches service providers or access points, they can still be reached via the same, unique Peppol ID, just like a phone number. Businesses can safely send invoices to each other via unique identification numbers (“Peppol IDs”). ## Launched in 2008 The internationally established Peppol network was launched in 2008 as a **test project by the European Commission**, which, jointly with 18 public authorities, provides funding. The objective? The objective of Peppol is to significantly **simplify the purchase-to-pay process** (read: the entire process from order request, procurement/purchasing to (automatic) invoice payment) between public authorities and suppliers through automated invoice processing. ## Based on open standards and specifications The Peppol network, based on open standards and specifications, uses a standardised format for electronic documents, which is Universal Business Language (UBL). UBL was developed to facilitate the exchange of electronic documents and to ensure that documents are exchanged in a standardised and understandable format. ## Secure network of “communities” Peppol consists of “communities”. Organisations can join Peppol through a community. These communities are always country-specific and facilitated by public authorities. For example, the Belgian Peppol community is **BOSA**. In the Netherlands, it is the Netherlands Peppol Authority (NPa). Peppol has various **security features** that cannot be achieved with standard emails. For instance, the Peppol protocol has mechanisms to guarantee a sender’s authenticity. Furthermore, an invoice in Peppol cannot be amended. Another important aspect is confidentiality, as all data sent between two Peppol Access Points is encrypted. Also, the local Peppol community is always the one that defines the Peppol IDs for that community. In Belgium, this is usually the **VAT number**, while in the Netherlands it is the Chamber of Commerce (KvK) number. ## The importance of Access Points Access Points provide access to the secure network for the sending and receiving of invoices. An Access Point can be compared to a telecom provider connecting your business to the telephone network. A Peppol Access Point connects you to the Peppol network. This is achieved through what are termed Peppol IDs, which you can use as a business, giving you access to the international invoicing network. ## Roll-out in various European countries An increasing number of countries are mandating the use of the Peppol network for sending e-invoices. In Belgium, it has been mandatory to use Peppol for invoicing Flemish public authorities since 2017. In the Netherlands, suppliers have been required to send e-invoices to public authorities since April 2019 if this is stipulated in the contract or stated in the tender. In Italy, sending e-invoices is already obligatory for B2B invoicing. This latter trend – business-to-business e-invoicing – has become unstoppable in recent years. ## The relevance of Peppol Peppol enables businesses and public authorities in Europe **to exchange electronic documents in a standardised way**. This means that businesses in the Peppol network benefit from a secure and efficient way of exchanging documents, without having to worry about the compatibility of different systems or the security of their documents. Peppol also offers businesses and public authorities the possibility to **save costs and improve their efficiency**. For example, businesses that use e-invoicing and the Peppol network can save time that would otherwise be spent on entering invoices manually. Furthermore, eliminating this manual input significantly reduces the risk of (human) errors. Public authorities also benefit from the efficiency of e-invoicing because it allows them to process and pay invoices faster. This **reduces their administrative burden**. **By the way, did you know that Billit has the largest Peppol Access Point not only in Belgium, but across the globe?** **Read more about sending and receiving invoices via Peppol with Billit.** !( Back to overview.
