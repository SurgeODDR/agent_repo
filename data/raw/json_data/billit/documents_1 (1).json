ML involves training systems to make predictions based on data. For example, facial recognition or voice recognition. In turn, LLMs can understand and self-generate natural language, images, or sound. Familiar examples include ChatGPT, DALL-E, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot. You can already use ML and LLM to speed up your administration. ### Six ways AI can help with your administration You might fantasise about leaving your administration entirely to AI, but that is not yet possible (unfortunately). It can, however, help you carry out certain tasks more efficiently: #### 1. Data input and processing AI lets you **automate** data entry and processing to a large extent. For example, you can **scan invoices** and extract relevant information such as amounts, dates and supplier names automatically. So, as you won’t have to manually retype those data, you will save a lot of time and avoid human error. This is the form of AI we have built into Billit’s ‘ Fast input’. You will read exactly how that works later in this article. #### 2. Accounting You can also use AI to automate various accounting tasks. Examples include automatically classifying transactions, preparing financial statements, or generating tax returns. AI helps to make these processes more efficient, saving time for you and your accountant. #### 3. Workflow automation AI can automate workflows by identifying and performing repetitive tasks, such as sending reminders for deadlines based on information in invoices or emails. #### 4. Cash flow forecasting AI analyses historical data to assist you in predicting your future cash flow. This helps you **improve financial planning** and prepare for potential deficits or surpluses. #### 5. Fraud detection AI can also help detect suspicious activity or transactions that may indicate fraud. This technology lets you recognise patterns that are hard to spot for you as a human. In this way, businesses will find it easier to prevent or minimise fraud. #### 6. Contract management You can use AI to analyse contracts and extract essential information such as expiry dates, terms and conditions, and obligations. This facilitates more efficient contract management, and you reduce the risk of missing critical deadlines. !Smartphone Billitapp’. You can then process those documents automatically using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).This process involves extracting data such as amounts and dates, which are then copied to an e-invoice or other digital document. This process uses **Machine Learning**. Our OCR is self-learning, meaning it becomes more accurate the more you use it. This is how it works: - Our software seeks to retrieve the data needed to create a structured invoice from each image or PDF imported into Fast input. This process involves saving **the coordinates** that indicate where the data are located on the document. - When a user corrects any of the detected fields, the OCR will also keep that information. Once the user has specified the **new value,** the software will search the document to save the coordinates of that too. - Our software uses all the data stored in this way to **better interpret** new images or PDFs. It is noteworthy that we built this system into Billit very early on, namely in 2014! As such, it is much older than the LLM applications that are so popular today. It is also great to know that **all Billit users** in fact help each other to make our OCR more accurate. Basically, you are doing a good deed every time you scan a new document with our software. NB - Incidentally, did you notice that we also used AI to create the image at the top of this blog post? For now, we wrote the text ourselves, although we drew some inspiration from ChatGPT for that too. !( Back to overview.

After that, I joined GS1 Belgium & Luxembourg as EDI Manager and Senior Product Specialist on transactional data exchange. I am also part of European work forces such as CEN TC 434 on e-invoicing and CEN TC 440 on e-procurement. On top of that, I also participate in several OpenPeppol working groups such as Peppol International Invoice (PINT) and Continuous Transaction Control (CTC). #### How did you get in touch with Billit? I first had contact with Billit when working for the government over 5 years ago. As part of my job, I tested several invoicing software tools that were available on the Belgian market. One of them was Billit, and I was pleasantly surprised with what it could do, even at that time. I contacted Billit to give feedback which was very much welcomed by founders Tom and Michael. It was their first contact with Peppol as Peppol only started in 2012. So I basically introduced them to it. Michael and Tom quickly understood the importance of Peppol and we kept contact ever since. #### Why did you decide to join the team? I immediately noticed the flexibility and ambition of Billit. As a start-up they are able to adapt to the quickly-changing market. Another great asset is that Billit started developing software for small companies first, instead of enterprises or public institutions. That too makes them more flexible and allows them to adapt their software to big companies and public entities, rather than having to do it the other way around. In terms of vision on the future, we’re a complete match. Not to mention the fun atmosphere and the fact that this young team desperately needed a grey-beard! #### What projects will you be working on? There is still a long way to go when it comes to Peppol as many countries are implementing mandatory e-invoicing. I will mostly work on international projects to align existing standards. My focus will certainly be on European countries such as France, Luxemburg, Italy, Germany and Spain for a start. But also globally, we will address markets such as Mexico, Japan, New Zealand and Australia where e-invoicing is becoming more urgent very soon. #### Where do you see the future of Peppol? Peppol is now mainly used to send and receive e-invoices securely, but it can do so much more. For example, you can use it in the 3-way matching principle. This means that you link a delivery report and an invoice to an order which ensures swift and correct payment. This concept allows companies to prevent fraud. Instead of limiting to e-invoices, we can even go back in the process to e-notification, e-catalogue and e-tendering, the so-called ‘e-procurement cycle’. Some countries, such as the Nordics and Italy, have already successfully implemented this process and I have no doubt that when companies see the benefits of using Peppol for e-ordering and e-invoicing, other types of documents will follow soon. !( Back to overview.

If anything is still unclear,be sure to get in touch with your prospective client about this. This shows that you are taking the enquiry seriously. For example, ask when the client wants the work done and whether price is a critical factor. Also make sure you check that you contact the actual decision-maker who will finally approve your quote. ## Tip 2: List all the essential elements in your quote As opposed to invoices, you do not have to consider legal requirements when creating quotes. Still, it is essential that your quotes are **complete and clear**. You should definitely include the following elements: - your company’s data - the client’s company data - the date the quote was created - a quote number - a detailed description of the work or services - a clear price proposal with hourly rate or total price - the planned schedule - the period of validity of the quote Also make sure you include your **general terms and conditions of sale**. ## Tip 3: Avoid grammatical and spelling errors when creating quotes Flawless quotes **convey professionalism**. In contrast, language and spelling errors may give your (future) client a bad first impression. The reasoning here is that if your spelling is sloppy, you might also deliver sloppy work. So, let someone with a keen eye for language check your quotes, or use Chat GPT if necessary. Whenever possible, adapt your language style to the type of client: a bank or insurance company requires a formal tone, whereas it is acceptable to use more informal language for a marketing agency or plumber. !Offerte Opmaken adapted to your client’s situation. This shows that you are taking your time with the enquiry and provides an opportunity to confirm agreements in writing and further emphasise the advantages of your company. That could help you win over hesitant clients. ## Tip 5: Include an estimate of ROI in your quote As soon as a client receives your quote, they will want to know what the purchase of a product or service will cost in total and what the return on this investment will be. If you, as a supplier, can quantify the pay-back period and ROI at this stage, it would be smart to mention this in your quote. That way, you show that you can properly estimate the cost and revenue of your product or service, and you save your client additional calculations. It might just be the final push your client needs to sign your quote. ## Tip 6: Be efficient, create quotes digitally in Billit Did you know that Billit **lets you easily and quickly create quotes** that your clients can sign digitally? In just a few clicks, you can add the required details to your quote and send the document digitally to your client. Or you can present the quote on your tablet and have them sign it straight away.

One of the building blocks in e-invoicing is UBL (Universal Business Language). In early 2015, Billit was one of the first invoicing software systems in Belgium that allowed entrepreneurs to send and automatically process UBL invoices. But what exactly is UBL? How does it work and what are the benefits? An overview. !( min !Op Weg Naar Digitaal Factureren Wat Is UBL, PDFs can be processed automatically, but it remains an error-prone process. After all, OCR software often has trouble recognizing a logo on invoices. Documents with a colored background and/or watermark can also cause this software to go haywire. Good to know: because OCR software cannot do calculations, it is best to always state the due date on the invoice instead of a payment term. ## How does UBL work? A UBL file - which is actually an XML file - may include the image of the invoice. In addition, all structured text components are labeled in the form of an XML recognition tag. This encoding allows computer programs to quickly recognize each exact part of an invoice, then correctly decode those parts. So by dividing an invoice (or other e-documents) into XML elements according to the UBL protocol, your computer can easily process this document. ## What are the advantages of UBL? Using UBL invoices provides numerous benefits to both the sender and the recipient. As the recipient, you don't actually have to do anything special to take advantage of UBL. **All you need is a software package that supports UBL.** This can be accounting or invoicing software. ### Advantages for the recipient - You no longer have to perform manual operations to process invoices: invoice data is automatically transferred from XML. This saves you a lot of time and money. - Because you do not have to retype invoices, the risk of expensive human errors is minimized. As a sender, you must use a software program that supports UBL. Creating a UBL file yourself is not that easy. Billit's invoicing software does this work for you: every invoice is automatically formatted in the UBL language. ### Advantages for the sender - Because your customers can process your invoices more easily, their satisfaction increases. After all, they don't have to spend valuable time on time-consuming administration tasks. Read: they can fully focus on their core tasks. - Because e-invoices are treated faster, the payment process runs a lot smoother. Customers will therefore generally pay you faster. Another important advantage for both sender and recipient is the **extra security when sending and processing e-invoices**. This is because UBL documents are exchanged via the secure Peppol network where authentication of the parties is included by default. !( Back to overview.

As a result, we are very effective in our approach and have built a lot of credibility in the industry. Exactly those are the biggest obstacles to grow in the world of e-invoicing. Moreover, the jury lauded that Billit offers solutions for both large and small companies. Thanks to our strong technological approach, our platform is performant and simple. This makes our model sustainable and suitable for growth to the general public. The jury also recognized that from the beginning we have involved the accounting industry in the development of our software. So we offer solutions not only for businesses, but also directly for accounting firms. Moreover, we invest a lot of effort in informing Belgian companies about e-invoicing, which was the decisive factor for the jury to award this prize to Billit. #### What does this award mean for Billit? First of all, it is a confirmation of our work and that we are on the right track. Where at the start of Billit we encountered a lot of misunderstanding and resistance, we see that companies are increasingly open to the benefits of e-invoicing. This is thanks to the work of our team. The award is therefore a well-deserved recognition of what they accomplish every day. They are the ones who, day in and day out, convince customers to get on board with the digital story. The award gives us courage and especially a lot of enthusiasm to continue like this. #### What other plans does Billit have? Of course we want to put e-invoicing even more on the map at home and abroad. Unfortunately, this is not easy due to the current Belgian legislation. Many other (European) countries have already introduced mandatory e-invoicing for B2B. This is not yet the case in Belgium. We know this obligation for the Flemish and Federal government, but not yet for companies. However, clarity is on the way: Belgium is drawing up a timeline to gradually make e-invoicing mandatory from 2024. This is why Billit is already starting the debate and informing all parties involved about how e-invoicing works and what the benefits are. We will be fully prepared for the enormous demand for e-invoicing and to successfully guide companies in their digitalization, both in Belgium and in the rest of Europe, by the time the official obligation is imposed. Of course, businesses don't have to wait that long. Those who start digital invoicing now take a big head start. !( Back to overview.

Moreover, platforms such as Billit allow you to effortlessly link to your accountant’s software. At the quarter-end, you can digitally deliver your accounts to your accountant at the touch of a button. There’s no need to drop in paperwork to a physical office, or email or send documents by WeTransfer. That means less work and hassle for you, and for your accountant (and therefore lower costs for you). 2. #### Reduced risk of errors As electronic invoices have all the info in a fixed place in the document, they can be read fully automatically by your customers' receiving software. By processing the invoices electronically, you also minimise the risk of human errors. E-invoices are prepared in Universal Business Language (UBL). This computer language lets you send the invoice data from your accounting package to your customers’ (and accountant’s) accounting package for processing. This ensures that customers always receive the correct payment details (account numbers and amounts), and that the data matches that on your purchase orders, delivery notes, etc. 3. #### Clear invoices Creating invoices is simple via the input fields that give you direct access to customer and product data. The software follows a preset layout to visually represent your digital invoice. So there is no more hassle with designing and adapting templates in Word or Excel, aligning text, staggered text blocks, entering formulas, etc. Your invoice will be ready to send in just a few clicks. 4. #### An increasing number of businesses are using (and requesting) e-invoices The use of electronic invoices is on the rise, and many governments are promoting it. For example, anyone invoicing the Flemish government has to send an e-invoice. You may already have customers using e-invoicing. Another advantage of e-invoices is that they require less processing time for your customers, and so are more likely to be paid quicker. But what if you switch to electronic invoicing and your customer doesn’t understand how to use it? No problem, because invoicing platforms such as Billit also let you send a PDF version of your invoice to your customer, and a PDF version is always sent along with your e-invoice. 5. #### Also easy for your purchase invoices on paper or in PDF format If you are using invoicing software, you can easily convert invoices you still receive on paper or in a PDF file into a digital document. This will also let you process and keep track of non-digital documents. The software reads and enters the data in the correct fields. You simply upload the file (PDF, an image of the invoice, etc.). When you use an invoicing platform such as Billit, you can take a picture and upload it via the app. 6. #### Safe and readily available Creating and managing e-invoices no longer requires you to download software. Some online invoicing platforms, such as Billit, only require a computer or tablet with an internet connection. Another advantage of such a SaaS (Software as a Service) solution is that the software is always up to date, so you don’t need to buy new versions or install updates every two years. If you use a word processor or Excel to create your invoices and generate them as PDFs, you don’t have that convenience. An online invoicing platform lets you store your data securely in the cloud, so the data is available anytime, anywhere. Another plus is that if your computer crashes or your laptop gets stolen, you will still have all your data. Moreover, online billing platforms often feature intelligent algorithms. An example? If someone has added an incorrect IBAN to a purchase invoice to wrongfully receive the money from the payment into this account, Billit will send you an alert. 7. #### A single solution for numerous administrative and accounting tasks Quotations, order forms, delivery notes, invoices and credit notes are all linked in an invoicing platform. You can turn quotations into purchase orders or invoices into credit notes in just a few clicks. There's no hassle with copy/paste and other manual adjustments. Unlike PDF files, electronic invoicing lets you automate numerous processes (subject to the software used). Some examples: A link to your bank lets you retrieve bank transactions from your business accounts and automatically reconcile your invoices. You can automatically send reminders to customers with outstanding invoices past the due date. With the numerous integrations, you can include QR codes on your invoices that customers can use to pay. Effortlessly link different Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software packages. Importing product catalogues or lists of customers and suppliers is also no problem! !( Back to overview.

This can be easily done with specialized e-invoicing software like BIllit. Get started right away with digital invoicing ### 120 % cost reduction Especially SMEs will need to invest in (new) software packages. To facilitate the transition for them, the Belgian government has decided that every **sole proprietorship or SME** can benefit from a **120% cost deduction** in income tax related to **structured electronic invoicing**. Specifically, this includes **subscription or advisory expenses for e-invoicing software**, such as personal consultancy. The measure applies to the taxable period from 2024 to 2027. To maximize the benefits of this rule, it is advisable to start early. ### Getting started with e-invoicing Do you have questions about the impact of electronic invoicing on your business or do want to know how to make the transition smoothly?

As this register contains data on Belgian Peppol users, it is important for receiving digital invoices through this network. The data held in the national SMP should be transferred to local SMPs by 2024. There is no issue for Billit users, as they will not be affected by this change. Why is that? Read on to find out... !Smp\") that was set up by the European Commission. The European Commission also maintains the identification details of all Peppol users worldwide in a central ‘address book’, the **Service Metadata Locator** ( **SML**). The SML refers to various SMPs – local address books so to speak – for more detailed information about these users. These SMPs contain details about the document types each user can receive and the Peppol Access Point they use… ### National SMP less relevant There are hundreds of SMPs worldwide, and the Belgian national SMP, smp.belgium.be, is just one of them. Like a number of other national governments, the Belgian government wanted to **centrally collect** the metadata of all companies in the country using Peppol. This meant that it could easily keep statistics on the number of Belgian users. A drawback of Belgium's national SMP is that it only accepts CBE and VAT numbers as unique ‘ identifiers’ for companies. It does not recognise other identifiers such as GLNs, or national identifiers from other countries, e.g. Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KvK) numbers. Yet companies with such identifiers also operate in Belgium. Over a year ago, the Belgian government decided that it would pull the plug on this project and stop offering the national SMP from 2024. After all, with the many local SMPs that had been launched in the meantime, the national register had lost some of its relevance. Moreover, in the future, the OpenPeppol organisation will keep its own user statistics and make them available. ### So, what now? Billit to the rescue! This government decision requires all user data from the national SMP to be transferred to a local SMP before the end of this year. Peppol users for whom this does not happen will not be able to receive digital invoices from 2024. But Billit users needn't worry, because we already transferred all our users’ data to our own SMP, smp.billit.be, at the beginning of November. As a user, you won't have noticed any difference: you can still send and receive digital invoices easily and quickly via our platform, and this will remain the case after 1 January 2024. Additionally, our own Billit SMP offers many advantages. It is stable, works quickly and is easily searchable. What’s more, we’re making it **available to other service providers who do not have their own SMP.** If you are interested in this or have other questions about the SMP switch, please feel free to contact us. Our experts will be delighted to give you more information. !( Back to overview in the eastern Belgian towns of Eupen and St. Vith was a hit. Read more.

Moreover, you can link your invoicing software to your online banking system, webshop(s), CRM software, etc. This ensures that you have a 360-degree overview and can make decisions based on directly available real-time data. 2. #### Time-saving Invoicing software lets you perform recurring tasks faster or even automate them completely. Such tasks include receiving invoices, preparing and sending invoices, checking payments, sending payment reminders and generating reports. At the quarter-end, you can easily forward your invoicing and administration to your accountant by linking to their accounting software. This stops you wasting time doing things manually, allowing you to concentrate on more critical tasks. And saving time means higher productivity and lower costs. 3. #### Reduced risk of errors Digital accounting involves electronic processes. The links allow the information to be automatically loaded into your invoices, purchase orders, delivery notes, etc., within your invoicing software, without having a parallel administration. So no more cutting, pasting or re-entering digital data, which reduces the risk of errors. Moreover, payment errors are a thing of the past, as you no longer have to enter amounts or account numbers. 4. #### Available 24/7, wherever you are Switching to digital accounting and invoicing software will facilitate remote working. With all accounting information and tools accessible everywhere, you don't need to have everyone together in the same place. Digital accounting is accessible whenever and wherever you want it – all you need is an internet connection and a device. Occasionally, different departments or employees require access to accounting information. Digital accounting allows you to make the information available to anyone who needs it, when and where it is required. This improves transparency and cooperation. And if necessary, you can always include restrictions to shield information. 5. #### Secure Managing your administration and invoicing online (and not on your server or computer) will prevent you from losing your data due to fire, theft, a crashed computer or carelessness. Automatic backups also eliminate the need to have a server or storage capacity, saving you space. The online invoicing software runs on several large servers where your data is safely stored. You do not have to update an online platform manually, as it’s all done automatically. What’s more, you don’t need to buy and install new versions of your invoicing software every two years. Finally, online invoicing platforms such as Billit let you send files securely via PEPPOL (Pan-European Public Procurement Online). This is a secure network co-funded by the European Commission and 18 government agencies. !( Back to overview.

With quishing, QR codes are used that, when scanned, take you to a **malicious website** where you have to make a payment or enter personal information. Also, in some cases, malicious software may be installed on your device. Scammers forward such fake QR codes mainly via email, text or WhatsApp and pretend that the sender is a trusted company, bank or public body to which you still owe money. However, paper documents, such as fake invoices or menus, can also contain manipulated QR codes. So you should always be careful when scanning QR codes of which you do not know the origin. ### How to protect yourself against quishing The number one rule is to be vigilant and always check the source of a QR code before scanning it. So be sure to check the sender’s email address or phone number. If it is any different from what you would expect, it is better not to scan the code. If you have already scanned the code, make sure you check which web page you land on. If there is no “https” in the address bar or the “lock” is missing, the connection will not be secure and it is best not to enter sensitive data. Moreover, always use a **secure QR scanner**. Some QR scanning apps come with built-in security features that check the security of a link before you open it. Finally, always make sure the software on your devices is **up to date**. Outdated software often presents security risks that hackers can exploit. ### You’re always safe with e-invoicing through Peppol If you use Billit to send and receive digital invoices through Peppol, you can be 100% sure that the QR codes added to these invoices are secure. In fact, any business using Peppol is registered on this network, giving you certainty about the origin of the QR code. When you set up a Billit account, your business will be automatically registered with Peppol based on a **trusted identifier**, such as your VAT number. You can recognize businesses in your lists of customers and suppliers that are already on the Peppol network by the green Peppol label. Moreover, you can request affiliated suppliers to start sending invoices via Peppol with just one click. This ensures you don’t run any risk of invoices with fraudulent QR codes. If any of your suppliers are not yet using Peppol, always check new invoices carefully to make sure they come from the same address as previous ones. If you notice anything suspicious, you should contact the supplier. !( Back to overview additional administration. This blog post lists all the things you need to be aware of. Read more.

You may immediately think of scanned paper invoices or invoices in PDF or Word format, but in fact that is not what we mean by this. 'Real’ digital invoices have a fixed structure, which is why we also often refer to them as **structured electronic invoices** or **SEIs**. Thanks to this structure, software packages worldwide can **read and process these digital invoices fully automatically**. Specifically, an SEI is a computer file in **XML format** (XML stands for Extensible Markup Language). So, it is a text file without any layout. The standard language used for such invoices is called the Universal Business Language or UBL. SEIs are generally not sent by email but over a secure network. The Peppol network is the best-known example, although other networks are used in some countries. In short: e-invoices ... 1. are created, transmitted and received electronically 2. are fully digital, no scans 3. consist of structured data 4. are sent over a secure network Also read: Why a PDF is not a structured electronic invoice ## What is wrong with paper invoices? Conventional paper invoices require **a lot of time** to process. They have to be sent, received, checked, paid, etc., and you need to keep a close eye on whether your client pays on time and send payment reminders if necessary. Furthermore, there is a fairly high risk of **human error** in paper-based processes. The result is wasted time, higher costs and negative effects on your business because you have less time to spend on your company's core activities that add real value. ## What are the advantages of digital invoices? Today’s digital capabilities let you **fully automate** your invoicing process to save time and avoid errors. The advantage of an SEI is that all invoicing data are captured in a **fixed place** in the digital file. It means that specialised software packages can use it to **automatically perform** tasks you used to have to do yourself. Tasks such as: - checking payments - sending payment reminders - delivering your records to your accountant - … Needless to say, this will translate into **significant efficiency gains and cost savings**. And there is more: e-invoicing will also **speed up the processing and payment** of your invoices, which, in turn, will benefit your cash flow. !Tablet Messageimr NL and all other common e-invoicing networks. Billit’s many useful features and integrations with other software packages allow you to automate your business processes as much as possible, so you can really concentrate on building your business. #### Try it now: Send your first digital invoice with Billit! ## In a growing number of countries, digital invoicing will soon be mandatory No doubt you have already heard that more and more countries worldwide are requiring or considering mandatory e-invoicing. The primary reason for this requirement is to **prevent invoice fraud** and **close the VAT gap**(the difference between the expected VAT revenue and the VAT revenue actually received). This is because digital invoices make it easier to detect fraud, on both a national as well as international levels. If such an obligation exists in your country or if one is forthcoming, this should certainly **not put you off**. As we said above, digital invoicing has numerous advantages for your business.

This means that at least one company in a VAT carousel charges its customer VAT, without declaring it to the tax authority. At the same time, it claims a VAT refund when reselling the goods. As such, the mala fide company keeps the VAT received, thus disadvantaging the treasury. VAT carousels can take different forms, but they often involve a **complex construction** with numerous companies in **different countries**. Companies that do declare their VAT in good faith can also end up as links in a VAT carousel. Indeed, the more complex the carousel setup, the more difficult it is for the authorities to detect the fraud. ### What is carousel fraud? Carousel fraud is a special form of tax fraud because the authorities do not just miss out on tax revenue, but even **lose money** on the fraudulent activities of the VAT carousel. Carousel fraud is possible because the tax authorities mostly trust the returns that companies must file themselves. Also, refunds are granted quite promptly. Audits are relatively sporadic, which means VAT carousels can often operate for quite some time. When the fraud eventually is discovered, the mala fide companies will often be long gone and the managing directors will have disappeared. !Blog Btwcarrousel Schema, and C. In this case, Company A is based in France, and Companies B and C in Belgium. Suppose that Company A supplies goods to Company B; it does not have to charge VAT for this because it is an intra-community supply (a cross-border supply within the EU). Company A also does not have to remit VAT to the authorities. If Company B then sells the same goods within Belgium to Company C, it will have to charge VAT for this and remit it to the VAT Authority. Should Company B decide not to declare VAT, then this company is fraudulent. In such a case, we refer to it as a **leak**. Company C will be entitled to deduct the VAT on the goods purchased on its VAT return. If Company C then sells the goods back to Company A in France, then (as with the first intra-community supply) no VAT will be charged and the carousel can start all over again. The fraudulent company in a VAT carousel (Company B in our example) is also known as the **missing trader** or **'buffer'**. Such companies are usually set up solely with a view to defrauding and are often completely ‘emptied’ over time. ### The consequences of carousel fraud The consequences of VAT carousel fraud for the authorities are clear as it could cost the treasury a lot of money, especially if the carousel remains active for months. And if your company is suspected of carousel fraud, the consequences will be considerable. Of course, there is the **reputational damage** in the event of a raid. Moreover, you may be **denied the right to the deduction of VAT**, which will be detrimental to your company’s liquidity. You could also be held jointly and severally liable for the entire unremitted VAT amount, at least if you knew (or should have known) about the fraud. Finally, you also risk **administrative penalties**. !Blog Btwcarrousel EN ### E-invoicing in the battle against VAT fraud One of the main developments in the battle against the **VAT gap** (the difference between the expected VAT revenues and the actual received VAT income) is that of Structured Electronic Invoices (SEIs) and their transmission via the secure Peppol network. The objective is to make it possible in the future to declare VAT in real time, based on data in electronic invoices. It would mean that authorities would no longer have to rely on the companies to be truthful in their returns, as VAT would be declared immediately on every sale. In this way, VAT carousel fraud and VAT fraud in general will become virtually impossible. In any case, electronic invoicing will make it easier to detect such practices quickly, both at Belgian and European levels. !( Back to overview additional administration.

This Processing Agreement shall be governed by and read in accordance with the legislation applicable to the Framework Agreement. The court mentioned in the Framework Agreement shall have sole jurisdiction to rule on any disputes arising from or in connection with this Processing Agreement.

The Client shall act as the Controller. • The Billit Platform is used to process certain personal data of the Client’s employees, customers, and suppliers. This mainly concerns identification and invoicing data. • The processing of personal data is necessary to provide the Billit Platform and to perform the agreement between the Client and Billit. Billit may also process personal data pursuant to its legal obligations. This processing will be necessary as long as the agreement between the Client and Billit is in force. Processing after the termination of the agreement will be possible if there is a legal obligation to do so, e.g., for statutory retention periods. • As the Processor, Billit shall only process personal data at the Client’s instructions. • Billit may engage Sub-processors for processing operations. The Client is entitled to object to the appointment of a new Sub-processor. • Billit shall ensure that its employees comply with strict confidentiality obligations.. • The GDPR imposes various obligations on processors. For example, they must provide an adequate level of data protection, and their appointment of any Sub-processors must also comply with certain conditions. Billit shall comply with these obligations. • To comply with the GDPR obligations, Billit must keep specific information available to the Client. If the Client so wishes, audits may be carried out to check Billit’s compliance with these obligations. Billit shall cooperate with such audits at reasonable times and by appropriate deadlines. Participation in an audit requires a significant effort by Billit’s employees involved. Therefore, this cooperation will be charged for. • Data Subjects may exercise their rights pursuant to the GDPR through the Controller. As the Processor, Billit shall assist the Client with this where necessary and possible. This cooperation will also be charged for. • Any Personal Data Breaches must be reported to the supervisory authority. Billit shall cooperate with the Client where necessary. The Client shall cover all of Billit’s reasonable costs in respect of this cooperation. • After termination of the agreement, Billit shall delete or return the personal data it has received and not retain them, except data that must be retained by law. • The Processor shall inform the Client without undue delay if it becomes aware of a Personal Data Breach and shall fully cooperate in handling it. • Billit (and the Sub-processors) shall not process personal data outside the European Economic Area without the Client’s prior written consent. !Billit cookies logo.

This agency implements the Romanian authorities’ tax policy, collects national taxes, and is responsible for all levies. ANAF has created the eFactura platform to exchange invoices digitally. Indeed, all e-invoices for Romanian businesses and public authorities must be uploaded in RO_CIUS format (the Romanian standard for digital invoices) on this platform. As such, Romania does not use the UBL format and Peppol, which is the standard in many other countries. ### How to send digital invoices to Romania Billit makes it extremely easy to send invoices to Romania. That’s because you can link our invoicing platform with that of ANAF, which means you can send and receive e-invoices directly from Billit **in the correct format**. There is no need to log into ANAF’s platform, so you can manage everything easily and quickly in your familiar Billit environment.

Examples include social media, erotic sites, gambling sites, or web shops selling alcohol or cigarettes. Depending on the country you live in, there are **various ways to verify your identity**. ## Safer for you and others We at Billit also believe it is essential to know the real identity of our clients. The important reasons for this are: ### 1. To ensure access to your account If you no longer have access to your account, for example, because you forgot your password or because multi-factor authentication (MFA) fails for some reason, you can always**regain access**, provided you can confirm your identity. ### 2. For improved customer service When you contact our support service via the help button in the Billit platform, it is important that your identity is verified so that our staff know exactly who is contacting them. Indeed, they can only give **specific details about your file once** they are certain of your identity. ### 3. To gain access to secure e-invoicing networks One of the major advantages of e-invoicing via Peppol and other networks is that it is much more secure than invoicing via mail or on paper. This is because anyone connected to such a network has to prove their identity. Therefore, when you receive an invoice through such a network, you are always **100 per cent sure of who the sender is**. So, to access Peppol and other e-invoicing networks via the **Billit Access Point,** you must first confirm your identity. ## Verifying your identity in Billit According to the country where your business is located, you can establish your identity in Billit in **various ways**.

This blog post lists all the things you need to be aware of. !( min !New Year, although it may be shorter or longer for legal entities. In the case of **natural persons** (self-employed in principal and secondary occupations), the new financial year always starts on **1 January**. In the case of **legal entities** (companies, not-for-profit associations, etc.), although it is customary to start the financial year on 1 January, it is not obligatory. So you could start your financial year at a different time of the year. If your financial year does start on 1 January, you should go through the **checklist** below at the end of the previous year or the start of the new one. If your fiscal year has a different start date, this list will still be helpful; the only difference is that you will have to go over it at a different time. ## 1.Check whether you still need to prepare and send invoices for 2024 You must send invoices for all your products and services within 15 days. While it is not a problem to prepare invoices in December, for example, for products or services you provided in November, keeping all records from the same year together is advisable. That way, **the profit calculation for your financial year will be correct**. Also read: Generating and sending invoices with Billit ## 2.Update the numbering of your invoices The following rules apply to invoice numbers: - Invoice numbers must consist of a **number sequence** or a **combination of numbers and letters**. - **Spaces** are not allowed (dashes are). - Each invoice number must **be unique** . - The invoice numbers should **be consecutive and sequential chronologically**. It is, therefore, perfectly acceptable for the numbering of your invoices to start with 1 and increase throughout the different years of operation. (Restarting is not allowed.) Nevertheless, many businesses find it easier to have their invoice numbers start with the year the invoices are sent. For example: - 20250001 - 20250002 - 20250003 - … If you choose that form, you will have to **adapt the numbering in Billit’s settings** at the start of the new year. Billit will then automatically generate consecutive invoice numbers for that year. Also read: Adjusting invoice numbering in Billit ## 3.Process all purchase invoices dated 2024 Do not wait too long to process and pay invoices for goods and services ordered by your company in 2024. Also read: Process purchase invoices in Billit ## 4.Cash up Your cash book is a **financial diary** that should be kept meticulously. It is where all incoming and outgoing cash movements are recorded. This should, in principle, **always be correct**, but especially at the end of the financial year, you would do well to (manually) count the money you have in cash and check whether it matches your cash book. Also read: Keeping a digital cash book in Billit ## 5. Update your daily cash receipts book Ensure all entries are accurate up to the end of the fiscal year. Do you keep your daily cash receipts book in Billit? Then December will automatically be closed as soon as you make an entry in the new fiscal year. Also read: Keeping a digital daily cash receipts book in Billit !Onderneemster Plantenwinkel ## 7.Check whether your terms and conditions are still current The new year is the perfect opportunity to consider whether you need to make changes to the general ‘standard contract’ between your company and your clients. ## 8.If necessary, adjust your periodic invoices If you automatically send periodic invoices via Billit, adjust the **amount** or **period** for the new year if necessary. You may also need to adjust the **standard text** (such as the year) on these invoices. You can also adjust the **period** if necessary. **Tip:** You can use dynamic parameters to automatically enter the correct date or period on your periodic invoices in Billit. Also read: Periodic invoices in Billit ### 9.If necessary, adjust the prices of your products You may start charging higher prices for certain products from 1 January (e.g. because of indexation). If so, be sure to update these prices in Billit as well. Also read: Add products in Billit ### 10.Start electronic invoicing via Peppol In many countries, electronic invoicing is becoming mandatory, but of course, you can start **e-invoicing** via Peppol before then. It’s easy with Billit. If you are not yet using Peppol to send your invoices, why not make a resolution to start doing so in your new financial year? You will see that it's straightforward. **Tip:** When you switch over, ask your suppliers to deliver your invoices digitally via Peppol as well. By the way, in Billit, under “Suppliers” you can see which of your suppliers are using Peppol and which are not (yet). !( Back to overview.
