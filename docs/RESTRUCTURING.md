# Repository Restructuring Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the repository restructuring process that was undertaken to improve organization, maintainability, and clarity of the codebase.

## Motivation

The original repository structure had several issues:

1. **Mixed Concerns**: Code, data, and documentation were mixed without clear boundaries
2. **Inconsistent Organization**: Different parts of the codebase followed different organizational patterns
3. **Scattered Files**: Related functionality was spread across different directories
4. **Root Directory Clutter**: Standalone scripts were placed in the root directory
5. **Unclear Dependencies**: Dependencies between components were not clearly defined

## New Structure

The new structure organizes the repository into a clear hierarchy:

```
repository/
├── src/                      # All source code
│   ├── core/                 # Core business logic 
│   │   ├── document/         # Document processing core functionality
│   │   ├── finance/          # Financial data processing
│   │   └── ai/               # AI integration components
│   ├── utils/                # Utility functions
│   │   ├── document/         # Document-specific utilities

│   ├── scripts/              # Standalone scripts and entry points
│   │   ├── document/         # Document processing scripts
│   │   ├── finance/          # Financial scripts
│   │   └── ai/               # AI scripts

│   ├── integration/          # Integration tests

└── scripts/                  # Repository-level scripts

```

## Key Changes

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**:
   - Core functionality is separated from utilities and scripts
   - Business logic is grouped by domain (document, finance, AI)
   - Configuration is centralized

2. **Improved Data Organization**:
   - Data is organized into raw, processed, and gold datasets
   - Clear separation between document, financial, and legal data

3. **Better Documentation**:
   - Documentation is organized by purpose (API, user guides, examples)
   - Research papers and findings are kept separate

4. **Testability**:
   - Tests are organized by type (unit, integration)
   - Test fixtures are separated for clarity

5. **Centralized Configuration**:
   - Configuration is centralized in `src/config/settings.py`
   - Environment variables are managed consistently

## Migration Process

The migration was implemented through a migration script (`scripts/setup/migrate_repository.py`) that performs the following steps:

1. Create the new directory structure
2. Create `__init__.py` files for all Python packages
3. Copy source files from the old structure to the new one
4. Organize data files according to their types
5. Update imports in the migrated files

## Future Improvements

1. **Documentation Generator**: Add a documentation generator for API documentation
2. **Continuous Integration**: Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
3. **Code Quality Tools**: Add code quality tools like Black, isort, and mypy
4. **Dependency Management**: Improve dependency management with more granular requirements files
5. **Version Control Hooks**: Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality checks

## Usage Guidelines

When adding new functionality to the repository, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Place files in the appropriate directories**:
   - Core business logic in `src/core/`
   - Utility functions in `src/utils/`
   - Standalone scripts in `src/scripts/`
   - Configuration in `src/config/`

2. **Use relative imports**:
   - Import from the appropriate module
   - Avoid circular dependencies
   - Use centralized configuration

3. **Update documentation**:
   - Document new functionality
   - Update README.md when necessary
   - Add examples for complex functionality

4. **Add tests**:
   - Add unit tests for core functionality
   - Add integration tests for complex interactions
   - Update test fixtures as needed
