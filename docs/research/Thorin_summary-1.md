# Detailed Summary of Thorin's Video about Rekkles

[TOC]

## 1. Overview and Purpose of the Video

- **Context:** Thorin clarifies this is not a typical “Thorin’s Thought” or “Thorin Versus.” Instead, it is a compilation of testimonies and stories from people who worked with or around the League of Legends player Martin “Rekkles” Larsson.
- **Goal:** Thorin’s intent is to share widespread, long-suppressed information about Rekkles’s career and behavior. Many individuals felt unable to speak out themselves due to fear of backlash or potential future consequences (e.g., needing to coach or play with him again).

## 2. Rekkles’s Public Image vs. Private Behavior

- **Star Status and Fan Perception:** Rekkles is known as a star figure with numerous accolades: four-time LEC/EU LCS champion, multiple MVP awards, and the first LEC player to reach 2,000 kills. His large following makes organizations hesitant to criticize him.
- **Contradiction in Public vs. Private:** Behind closed doors, many ex-teammates, coaches, and staff describe him as extremely difficult, two-faced, or manipulative. Despite a soft-spoken, humble public persona, they report a starkly different personality in practice.

## 3. Common Complaints: Personality and Psychological Traits

- **Two-Faced / Manipulative:** Multiple sources call him “passive-aggressive,” describing a pattern where he acts kind or friendly outwardly, then withholds communication or backstabs people in private.
- **Narcissism / Control of Image:** Some feel he invests heavily in shaping public perception (e.g., reading Reddit, responding to critics by changing small in-game behaviors temporarily), rather than focusing on genuine improvement.
- **Emotional Swings and Isolation:** Teammates frequently mention that when conflicts arise, he may vanish, refuse to speak, or lock himself away for extended periods. Others interpret some of his onstage tears or emotional moments as orchestrated.

## 4. Behavior in Teams and Scrims

- **Frequent Freezing Out / Muting:**
  - Many claim he would mute or ignore teammates in scrims if upset. For instance, he sometimes muted his support or even coaches during games, making coordination impossible.
  - When criticized or confronted, he might respond by refusing to talk for days.
- **Passive-Aggressive Sabotage:**
  - Some stories suggest Rekkles would “punish” teammates by intentionally making poor in-game choices (e.g., refusing to contest objectives, not following up kills) to prove a point if he disagreed with them.
  - If forced to play a champion he disliked (e.g., Ashe, Kalista), he would intentionally feed in scrims or sabotage the pick, thus undermining the suggestion.

## 5. Playstyle and Champion Pool Issues

- **Safe / ‘KDA Player’:**
  - A major recurring complaint is that Rekkles refuses to engage in risky fights unless they are 100% favorable.
  - He often sticks to champions with escapes (e.g., Ezreal, Tristana, Sivir, Xayah) and rarely picks meta-aggressive champions (like Draven, Lucian, Caitlyn) unless absolutely forced.
  - Teammates complain he will not sacrifice even if it’s beneficial for the team and sometimes abandons allies mid-fight.
- **Draft Constraints:**
  - Teams regularly had to ban certain champs or revolve entire strategies around Rekkles’s picks and aversions.
  - He often cited “lack of practice” or a need for “perfect knowledge” as reasons not to attempt new or aggressive champions, severely limiting drafting flexibility.

## 6. Relationships with Specific Teammates and Coaches

### Fnatic Tenure (Multiple Eras)
- Suffered ongoing conflicts with coaches (like Daylor, YoungBuck, Mithy) and teammates (e.g., Hylissang, Bwipo).
- **Benchings and Ultimatums:** In 2018, Fnatic tested benching Rekkles with Bwipo as ADC; although they reversed course due to poor scrim results, it illustrates how drastic the team’s frustrations became.
- Frequent stories of him refusing to speak after arguments, moving his desk to a corner, or “ghosting” the entire lineup except on stage.

### G2 Esports (2021)
- The team reportedly did not initially want him; they tried Hans Sama, Carzzy, Upset, even Pinoy as alternatives.
- Once signed, conflicts emerged with players like Mikyx (e.g., the “wireless headset” incident where Rekkles privately trashed him, unaware Mikyx could still hear).
- Ultimately, G2 parted ways with him, amid claims that Caps and Jankos did not want to continue playing alongside him.

### Karmine Corp (2022)
- Reports indicate he showed up unprepared for the level of competition in the LFL, clashed with coach Stryker, and undermined synergy with supports like Hantera.
- Engaged in questionable conduct, such as scheduling large tattoo sessions during the season and missing practice time.
- Some staff left the organization, citing Rekkles’s behavior as a major reason.

## 7. Allegations of Manipulation and “Team Management” Behind the Scenes

- **Roster Influence:**
  - He often privately told management to replace certain players (including veterans) while telling those same teammates he wanted them to stay.
  - Former teammates realized he had tried to engineer their removals despite portraying himself as supportive.
- **Gaslighting Fans:**
  - Sources say he adopts a specific on-camera persona (soft-spoken, shy) and uses public platforms to push narratives that serve him—often portraying himself as the victim of organizations like Fnatic or G2.

## 8. Emotional Patterns and Possible Causes

- **Dark Triad / Sociopathy Accusations:**
  - Several testimonies speculate severe personality issues, describing him as “able to turn emotion on and off” or “dead inside” once cameras aren’t rolling.
  - People who tried to help him or offer emotional support felt they made no progress, leading them to pity or resent him.
- **Isolation and Loneliness:**
  - Despite being socially withdrawn and conflict-averse, he invests heavily in managing external impressions, leaving him with few close friendships in the scene.

## 9. Off-Season Moves and Contract Disputes

- **Leaving Fnatic for G2 and Then Returning:**
  - Rekkles claimed a 99% chance to stay at Fnatic, but “found the 1%” to switch to G2.
  - Later, he ended up in Karmine Corp due to benching, buyout complications, and finally rejoined Fnatic.
  - Discrepancies exist regarding whether he paid any personal buyout, with some suspecting it was a publicity tactic.
- **Secrecy and Public Narrative:**
  - Each major move was accompanied by conflicting official stories and behind-the-scenes accounts, suggesting he was actively pushing for more money or that organizations quietly wanted to remove him but feared backlash.

## 10. Overall Conclusions

- **Pervasive Negative Experiences:** Across multiple teams (Fnatic, G2, Karmine Corp), staff, coaches, and teammates consistently cite Rekkles’s challenging behavior, refusal to adapt, hostility to direct feedback, and manipulative tendencies.
- **Protected by Star Status:** His massive fanbase and marketing appeal often shielded him from accountability, as organizations worried about the fallout from benching or exposing him.
- **Evolving Reputation:** Eventually, enough former colleagues shared stories that the “real” behind-the-scenes Rekkles became common knowledge among pros, even though fans continued seeing him as a soft-spoken star.

## 11. Key Takeaways

1. **Consistency of Complaints:** The sheer volume of aligned stories suggests a long-term pattern rather than isolated incidents.
2. **Impact on Teams:** Coaches and teammates often had to revolve drafting, shot-calling, wave management, and champion picks around Rekkles’s constraints. Internal tensions and dramatic standoffs were common.
3. **Emotional Manipulation:** Team members repeatedly mention a “fear of crossing him,” referencing passive-aggressive or sabotage-type punishments.
4. **Public vs. Private Discrepancy:** Many find the biggest frustration is how fans see him as gentle and victimized, while insiders witness a far more complex, often toxic dynamic.

## Final Summary

Overall, Thorin’s video presents a broad, critical perspective on Martin “Rekkles” Larsson’s career, revealing numerous behind-the-scenes accounts of conflict, manipulation, and emotional volatility. While Rekkles’s talent and achievements are acknowledged, the recurring testimonies paint a portrait of a player who is extremely difficult to work with: frequently uncommunicative or two-faced in scrims, fixated on preserving his KDA, reluctant to expand his champion pool, and adept at influencing both public opinion and internal rosters. Teams across multiple years struggled with his behavior, yet withheld public criticism due to his star power and large fan following. The video suggests that the widely accepted public narrative of Rekkles as a modest, soft-spoken victim of organizational mistreatment may be incomplete; behind the scenes, countless staff and teammates describe a pattern of interpersonal issues that led many to conclude he is one of the most challenging pros to manage or play alongside.
