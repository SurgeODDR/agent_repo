# Funding Opportunities under the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) for GenAI Startups in Belgium

Early-stage **Generative AI (GenAI) startups in Belgium** can tap into a range of EU funding opportunities under the **Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP)**. STEP is an EU initiative to **boost investments in critical technologies** – including artificial intelligence – by steering resources from various EU programs Below is a structured overview of relevant funding options (grants, subsidies, and investment-based support), along with eligibility criteria, application processes, and key deadlines for each program.

## Overview of the STEP Initiative and GenAI Focus

**STEP** was launched to enhance EU industrial competitiveness by supporting projects in three strategic areas: **digital & deep-tech innovation, clean tech, and biotech** Generative AI falls under the **digital deep-tech** category, making GenAI startups prime candidates for STEP-aligned funding. STEP itself is not a single fund but a **platform coordinating 11 EU programs** to channel support toward strategic tech projects Key features of STEP include: 

- A **STEP Seal of Excellence** awarded to high-quality projects in certain programs (Digital Europe, Horizon Europe, etc.), which boosts their visibility to investors  
- A **one-stop portal** for funding opportunities, consolidating open calls from various EU and national programs relevant to strategic technologies ([About the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP)](https://strategic-technologies.europa.eu/about_en#step-funding-and-programmes#:~:text=Funding%20at%20EU%20level%20providing,grants%20and%20STEP%20Seal))   
- **No new eligibility rules** – projects must meet the criteria of each underlying EU funding program, but with an emphasis on strategic tech impact

For GenAI startups, STEP’s **“Digital technologies and deep-tech”** focus means many AI-related funding schemes (e.g. EU research grants, innovation grants, equity investments) are in scope. In fact, the EU is **prioritizing generative AI**: for example, the 2025 EIC Work Programme introduced a specific **“GenAI4EU” EIC Accelerator Challenge** to create European champions in generative AI ([EU funding for startups: top 20 grants to apply for in 2025](https://www.femaleswitch.com/playbook/tpost/ci4ycih9a1-eu-funding-for-startups-top-20-grants-to#:~:text=The%20EIC%20Accelerator%20supports%20startups,space%20tech%2C%20and%20future%20mobility))  ([GenAI4EU: Creating European Champions in Generative AI - European Commission](https://eic.ec.europa.eu/eic-funding-opportunities/eic-accelerator/eic-accelerator-challenges-2025/genai4eu-creating-european-champions-generative-ai_en#:~:text=While%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20,to%20revolutionize%20these%20fields%20further))  This reflects the EU’s commitment to nurturing AI innovation and ensuring Europe’s tech sovereignty in AI.

## EU Grant and Subsidy Funding Opportunities for GenAI Startups

Several EU programs under STEP offer **grants or subsidies (non-dilutive funding)** that are relevant to early-stage AI startups. These typically do not require repayment or equity. Key grant-based funding options include:

- **European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator** – *Horizon Europe (Pillar III)*:  
  The EIC Accelerator provides a mix of grant and equity funding for **high-impact startups and SMEs** with disruptive innovations. It offers **grants up to €2.5 M** (non-repayable) and the option of equity investment (see investment section) GenAI startups are a focus area: the EIC Accelerator has both **Open calls (no topic restrictions)** and **Challenge calls**. Notably, in 2025 a Challenge call titled **“GenAI4EU: Creating European Champions in Generative AI”** specifically targets startups developing transformative AI solutions ([EU funding for startups: top 20 grants to apply for in 2025](https://www.femaleswitch.com/playbook/tpost/ci4ycih9a1-eu-funding-for-startups-top-20-grants-to#:~:text=The%20EIC%20Accelerator%20supports%20startups,space%20tech%2C%20and%20future%20mobility))  ([GenAI4EU: Creating European Champions in Generative AI - European Commission](https://eic.ec.europa.eu/eic-funding-opportunities/eic-accelerator/eic-accelerator-challenges-2025/genai4eu-creating-european-champions-generative-ai_en#:~:text=While%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20,to%20revolutionize%20these%20fields%20further))  

  **Eligibility:** Single startups or SMEs (including individuals planning to found an SME) from EU Member States or associated countries can apply Projects should have a prototype or proof of concept at ~TRL 5-6 and potential to scale internationally  
  **Application Process:** A **two-step application** via the EU Funding & Tenders portal First, a short application (pitch deck, video, concept) can be submitted any time (continuous intake) If successful, you’re invited to submit a full proposal by the next cut-off deadline. Full proposals include a detailed business plan and are followed by a **jury interview** for finalists ([EIC Accelerator - European Commission](https://eic.ec.europa.eu/eic-funding-opportunities/eic-accelerator_en#:~:text=invited%20to%20prepare%20a%20full,Open%20or%20Accelerator%20Challenge%20funding))   
  **Deadlines:** For 2025, there are **two major cut-off dates for full proposals: 12 March 2025 and 1 October 2025*. (Short proposals are accepted year-round, but plan ahead to clear step 1 in time for these deadlines.) The GenAI Accelerator Challenge follows the same deadlines within the EIC Accelerator call.  

- **Horizon Europe – Research & Innovation Actions (Cluster 4: Digital, Industry and Space)**:  
  Horizon Europe is the EU’s flagship R&D program. **Cluster 4** covers digital technologies and often features calls for projects in AI, data, and robotics. While these are typically collaborative projects (consortia of multiple organizations), early-stage startups can participate as partners (or even coordinators, if experienced). For example, Horizon Europe 2024/25 work programmes include calls on **software engineering for AI and generative AI** (e.g. a call titled *“Software Engineering for AI and generative AI”* under Cluster 4) ([[PDF] EN Annex VI Horizon Europe Work Programme 2025 7. Digital ...](https://sciencebusiness.net/sites/default/files/inline-files/HORIZON-CL4-2025_V5.07.pdf#:~:text=,HADEA.%20Specific%20conditions))  These grants fund R&D and innovation activities and can help a GenAI startup develop technology in cooperation with universities or industry. 

  **Eligibility:** Usually requires a **consortium of at least 3 independent entities from 3 different EU/Associated countries**. Startups can join consortia to contribute their AI expertise. The project’s scope must match the specific call topic (e.g. AI applications, platforms, etc.).  
  **Application Process:** Proposals are submitted through the Funding & Tenders portal, responding to published **call texts** in the Horizon Europe Work Programme. Each call has detailed topic descriptions and evaluation criteria. Startups should network to find partners via brokerage events or the **STEP portal**, and then co-write a proposal.  
  **Deadlines:** Vary per call – each Horizon Europe call has a fixed deadline (usually once per year or per work programme cycle). For instance, calls in the 2024-2025 digital work programme might have deadlines in late 2024 or mid-2025. Always check the official call page on the Funding & Tenders portal for the exact deadline. Missing the deadline means waiting for the next call edition (if any).  

- **Digital Europe Programme (DIGITAL)**:  
  The Digital Europe Programme provides grants to build strategic digital capacities in the EU, including artificial intelligence, high-performance computing (HPC), and data infrastructure. While many DIGITAL calls fund large-scale projects (e.g. establishing AI testing facilities or “AI factories”), they often involve industry participation and can benefit AI startups. For example, the EU launched an **“AI Factories” call** to help AI developers train large generative models on European supercomputers Another call “Towards networked Local Digital Twins in the EU” explicitly seeks solutions using **generative AI for simulations and predictive models** ([Towards networked Local Digital Twins in the EU - Search for Funding](https://www.euro-access.eu/en/calls/1433/Towards-networked-Local-Digital-Twins-in-the-EU#:~:text=Funding%20www.euro,sectors%20and%20use%20cases))  Winning or joining such projects can give startups grant funding, technical resources (like supercomputing time), and valuable partnerships. 

  **Eligibility:** Usually requires consortia with multiple organizations from different EU countries (often including tech companies, research institutes, and public entities). Some smaller grant opportunities under DIGITAL (or related initiatives) use **cascade funding**, where an EU-funded project runs open calls to award sub-grants to startups/SMEs for experiments or adoption of AI. In those cases, a single startup can apply to the project’s open call.  
  **Application Process:** For direct DIGITAL calls, proposals are submitted on the Funding & Tenders portal in response to call texts published by the European Commission (HaDEA agency). For cascade funding opportunities, the startup would apply via the managing project’s website – these are typically lighter applications focusing on a project pitch.  
  **Deadlines:** Each DIGITAL call has a specific deadline (e.g. a call in 2024 for AI development closed on May 29, 2024. **Some AI-related calls are continuously open with periodic cut-offs**. For instance, the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking’s call for AI access had an open window until end of 2025 with periodic evaluation dates ([EU boosts European AI developers with the AI Factories call for ...](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en%5E/ip_24_4621#:~:text=EU%20boosts%20European%20AI%20developers,on%204%20November%202024))  Startups should monitor the STEP portal or the Digital Europe call listings for current deadlines.

- **Prizes and Other EU Initiatives:**  
  In addition to formal programs, the EU sometimes launches **prize competitions or challenges** to spur AI innovation. For example, in 2024 the European Commission organized an **“AI Grand Challenge”** with awards (including cloud/computing resources and funding) for top AI startups GenAI startups should watch for such contests or pilot programs (often announced via the STEP news feed or EU press releases). These can provide not just funding but also publicity and support. Eligibility and application for prizes vary by competition (usually a proposal or demo submission, then pitching). Deadlines are set per competition and are announced in their calls (e.g. the AI awards in Brussels had a proposal submission phase and a fixed award date.

**Note:** Being based in **Belgium** means startups can also leverage national implementations of EU funds. Under STEP, **Cohesion Policy funds** (e.g. European Regional Development Fund, Recovery and Resilience Facility) are being reallocated by Member States to support strategic tech Belgium’s regions may offer **innovation subsidies or vouchers** for AI startups co-financed by EU funds. These are managed by local authorities (e.g. regional innovation agencies) rather than by the European Commission. For information on such opportunities, Belgian startups can consult their **National Contact Points (NCPs)**or the STEP portal’s country-specific section.

## EU Investment-Based Support for GenAI Startups

Beyond grants, the EU provides **investment-based support** – equity financing, loans, or guarantees – to help startups scale. Under STEP, new and existing instruments offer **risk capital** to high-potential companies:

- **EIC Accelerator (Equity Component via the EIC Fund)**:  
  As part of the EIC Accelerator, startups can request an **equity investment from €0.5 million up to €10 million** (occasionally more for certain cases) from the **EIC Fund** This is typically combined with or following an EIC grant (“blended finance”), but **investment-only support** is also possible (especially for companies that already received a grant or for certain mid-caps) The EIC Fund invests in the startup’s equity (usually minority stake) to fuel market deployment and scale-up. For a GenAI startup, this equity can support expensive R&D (like computing infrastructure) and growth efforts. Selection for EIC equity occurs through the same Accelerator application process and jury evaluation described above. If your proposal is approved, the EU (via the EIC Fund) negotiates an investment agreement. **No separate deadline** beyond the Accelerator call deadlines; it’s part of the EIC Accelerator award (2025 cut-offs on 12 March and 1 October)

- **EIC STEP Scale-Up Initiative (€10–30 million investments)**:  
  Launched in late 2024, the **STEP Scale-Up** scheme is a dedicated **scale-up equity fund under EIC** aimed at larger funding rounds. It provides **equity investments between €10M and €30M per company** through the EIC Fund This is designed to fill the growth-stage financing gap for Europe’s strategic tech startups. A GenAI startup that has progressed beyond seed stage and is seeking, say, a Series B round in the €10-30M range could apply here. Notably, **applicants must show initial market interest by securing a private investor commitment for at least 20% of the round** The program’s **2025 budget is €300M** (meaning roughly 10-30 companies might be funded)

  **Eligibility:** Open to **startups, SMEs, and small mid-caps** in EU/associated countries that operate in STEP’s strategic domains (digital/AI, clean tech, biotech) ([STEP Scale Up - European Commission](https://eic.ec.europa.eu/eic-funding-opportunities/step-scale_en#:~:text=))  The company should be looking to raise a major round and have a lead investor (e.g. venture capital or corporate investor) ready to co-invest at least 20%. Generative AI ventures qualify under the “digital and deep tech” scope, which explicitly includes AI and related fields ([STEP Scale Up - European Commission](https://eic.ec.europa.eu/eic-funding-opportunities/step-scale_en#:~:text=))   
  **Application Process:** **Continuous intake** – you can apply at any time via the EU Funding & Tenders portal There are no fixed deadlines or batch cut-offs; proposals are evaluated on a rolling basis. The application requires a detailed **business plan (up to 50 pages)**, a pitch deck, an investor **pre-commitment letter**, and an ownership structure declaration If eligible, the startup is invited to a **jury interview**, similar to the Accelerator process Decisions are made within weeks: ~4-6 weeks to get an interview invite after submission, and ~2 weeks after the interview for final outcome Successful projects not only receive the investment but also a **“Sovereignty Seal” (STEP Seal)** as a mark of excellence, plus access to EIC Business Acceleration Services (Even if not funded, eligible applicants get feedback to improve for future attempts) 

- **InvestEU and EIF-Supported Investments**:  
  The **InvestEU Fund** is another EU-level tool supporting startups via financial intermediaries. It doesn’t fund companies directly; instead, it provides EU guarantees to investment funds, banks, and national institutions to encourage them to invest in or lend to businesses in strategic sectors Under STEP’s digital tech window, InvestEU is steering more capital toward deep-tech and AI. For example, the European Investment Fund (EIF) – backed by InvestEU – invests in venture capital funds that, in turn, fund startups. Early-stage GenAI startups might benefit from this indirectly if they raise capital from VC funds supported by EIF (which often have mandates to invest in EU tech innovation). Similarly, the **European Investment Bank (EIB)** offers venture debt products and loans for innovative companies, and these are expected to increase for STEP sectors (digital, cleantech, etc.). 

  **Eligibility & Access:** There’s no direct “InvestEU application” for startups. Instead, startups should look for VC funds or banks that have EU backing. For instance, a Belgian AI startup could approach local VC funds that received EIF investments under the AI/tech focus or explore programs like the EIB’s Innovation Finance. The **InvestEU Portal** is a useful matchmaking platform where startups can **pitch their projects to investors**; projects with a STEP Seal or EU label have increased visibility there In summary, while not a grant, the EU’s investment ecosystem (via InvestEU/EIF/EIB) is a crucial avenue to secure growth funding for your startup alongside private investors. No fixed deadlines – these are ongoing opportunities via financial intermediaries and investment rounds.

## Eligibility, Application & Deadline Summary by Program

To clarify the requirements and timelines, here is a summary for each major funding program relevant to GenAI startups:

- **EIC Accelerator (Horizon Europe)** – *Grants up to €2.5M + optional Equity up to €10M*.  
  **Who Can Apply:** Single **startups or SMEs** (including early-stage companies) established in an EU Member State (like Belgium) or associated country Must be developing a novel, high-risk innovation with serious scale-up potential (e.g. a new GenAI application that could create or disrupt markets)  
  **How to Apply:** Via **Funding & Tenders Portal**, first submit a **Short Application** (pitch deck, 3-min video, and a brief form) – no deadline for this stage (continuous) If successful, prepare a **Full Application** (detailed proposal, ~ pitch deck, 3-year financials, etc.) by the next deadline, then, if selected, attend a **jury interview** in Brussels.  
  **Upcoming Deadlines:** *Full application cut-offs in 2025:* **12 March 2025** and **1 October 2025*. (Typically ~2 cut-offs per year; for 2026 and beyond, check updated work programmes.) The Accelerator Challenge “GenAI4EU” follows the same schedule within these cut-offs.

- **EIC STEP Scale-Up (STEP Equity Facility)** – *Equity investments €10–30M (growth stage)*.  
  **Who Can Apply:** **Startups, scale-ups (SMEs) or small mid-cap companies** in a strategic tech sector (AI included) seeking a large investment round. Must have a private investor ready to co-invest at least 20% of the round Companies should be EU/assoc.-based and demonstrate significant potential to impact EU technological sovereignty.  
  **How to Apply:** **Continuous application** via the Funding & Tenders Portal (no call deadline) Submit required documents (business plan, pitch, investor letter, etc.). After a quick eligibility check, present at a **jury interview** within weeks If approved, the EIC Fund co-invests alongside your lead investor.  
  **Deadlines:** *No fixed deadlines.* You can apply at any time. It’s recommended to time your application when you have your investment round organized (since proof of investor commitment is needed). Budget is available for 2025 onward on a rolling basis.

- **Horizon Europe (Collaborative R&D Grants)** – *Grant funding for R&D projects (no equity)*.  
  **Who Can Apply:** Consortia of **minimum three organizations from 3 different EU/Assoc. countries** (often includes universities, research centers, corporates, and possibly startups/SMEs). Startups can join as partners to contribute innovation and also benefit from funding for their part in the project. Relevant calls are usually under **Cluster 4 – Digital, Industry & Space** or cross-cutting AI topics in other clusters.  
  **How to Apply:** Find a relevant **call for proposals** on the Funding & Tenders Portal or STEP dashboard. Either form a consortium or join one via networking. Submit a **proposal document** (~50 pages) by the call deadline, addressing the research/innovation objectives, work plan, and consortium credentials. The proposal is evaluated by experts, and winning consortia sign a Grant Agreement with the Commission.  
  **Deadlines:** Each call has its own deadline (typically once per year or per work programme). For example, a “generative AI” related call in Cluster 4 might have a deadline in **spring or autumn of 2025** – always check the official call page for exact dates. Horizon Europe Work Programmes for 2025 list calls like *“GenAI4EU”* under EIC (as above) and others like “Software engineering for AI” with specified deadlines ([[PDF] EN Annex VI Horizon Europe Work Programme 2025 7. Digital ...](https://sciencebusiness.net/sites/default/files/inline-files/HORIZON-CL4-2025_V5.07.pdf#:~:text=,HADEA.%20Specific%20conditions))  **Tip:** Keep an eye on the calls announced in the Horizon Europe 2025-2027 Work Programme and plan at least 3-6 months ahead to assemble a consortium and write the proposal.

- **Digital Europe Programme (Digital Capacity Grants)** – *Grants for deployment and capacity building (no equity)*.  
  **Who Can Apply:** Typically **consortia** (including companies, public bodies, research orgs) from multiple EU countries. Some actions (like SME support networks or innovation hubs) might involve giving sub-grants to startups, in which case individual startups can apply to those sub-calls. GenAI startups should look for DIGITAL calls on AI, data, or HPC where SME participation is sought (either as a consortium member or later as a third-party beneficiary).  
  **How to Apply:** For direct calls: similar to Horizon Europe, submit a consortium proposal via the Funding & Tenders Portal by the call’s deadline. For **cascade funding** opportunities: find relevant projects (for example, AI innovation incubators or experimental facilities funded by DIGITAL) and apply through their websites for the specific open calls. The STEP portal and **EU Funding & Tenders** site often indicate if a call uses cascade funding.  
  **Deadlines:** Vary per call. DIGITAL calls are opened and closed on a rolling basis throughout the EU budget period. For instance, an **AI infrastructure call in 2024 had a deadline in May 2024*. Some AI-focused calls starting in late 2024 may have deadlines in early 2025. Always refer to the **Digital Europe “Funding” page** for current calls and timelines.

- **InvestEU / EIF Financing** – *Indirect equity or loans via financial partners*.  
  **Who Can Apply:** Startups **do not apply directly** to InvestEU. Instead, eligibility depends on the criteria of the **VC fund or bank** providing the financing. EU-backed VC funds will have their own investment focus and selection process for startups (e.g. sector focus, stage, ticket size), and banks offering InnovFin or similar loans will assess creditworthiness and project merit. Being an innovative AI startup in the EU is generally a plus, as many intermediaries have mandates to support such companies thanks to EU guarantees.  
  **How to Access:** Identify venture funds that invest in AI and check if they have EIF support (EIF’s website and press releases list funds they invest in). Likewise, look into programs like **EIB’s Innovation Loans** or national banks’ startup loan schemes backed by InvestEU. Engage with those investors or lenders through their normal application or pitching processes. Additionally, consider creating a profile on the **InvestEU Portal** – it’s a database where EU-based projects seek investment; having a **STEP Seal** or being aligned with EU priority tech can attract interest  
  **Deadlines:** None (ongoing). These investments occur as part of the market-driven funding cycle. For instance, VC funds typically raise capital (with EIF contributions) and then invest over a few years – they will consider startups on a rolling basis. Loan programs might have budget availability per year but accept applications continuously until funds are exhausted.

## Additional Tips and Resources

- **National Contact Points (NCPs):** Since navigating EU funding can be complex, Belgium’s NCPs for Horizon Europe and Digital programs can provide guidance. They offer free advice on eligibility, finding partners, and proposal writing Belgium’s NCPs (e.g. NCP Flanders, NCP Wallonie) have experts for digital/industrial topics and for the EIC Accelerator, who can help GenAI startups strengthen their applications.

- **STEP Portal and EU Funding Portals:** The **STEP online portal** is a great starting point to search for **open calls** and filter by technology area and funding type It aggregates relevant opportunities across programs. Additionally, the main **EU Funding & Tenders Portal** lists all EU calls (not only STEP-focused ones). Use keywords like “AI” or “machine learning” to find calls, and read the call texts carefully to ensure your project fits. Remember, STEP itself doesn’t run separate calls; it highlights and boosts those in existing EU programs that align with strategic tech goals

- **Prepare Thoroughly:** EU funding is competitive. Whether you go for a grant or an equity investment, be prepared to demonstrate how your GenAI technology is **innovative** and impactful in Europe. Emphasize how it contributes to EU priorities (digital sovereignty, ethical AI, etc.), as this is often a consideration – especially under STEP objectives ([GenAI4EU: Creating European Champions in Generative AI - European Commission](https://eic.ec.europa.eu/eic-funding-opportunities/eic-accelerator/eic-accelerator-challenges-2025/genai4eu-creating-european-champions-generative-ai_en#:~:text=increasing%20the%20security%20of%20European,to%20revolutionize%20these%20fields%20further))  ([GenAI4EU: Creating European Champions in Generative AI - European Commission](https://eic.ec.europa.eu/eic-funding-opportunities/eic-accelerator/eic-accelerator-challenges-2025/genai4eu-creating-european-champions-generative-ai_en#:~:text=In%20line%20with%20the%20AI,in%20a%20critical%20technology%20area))  For example, a proposal under the GenAI4EU challenge should address issues like AI trustworthiness and human-centric design in line with EU values ([GenAI4EU: Creating European Champions in Generative AI - European Commission](https://eic.ec.europa.eu/eic-funding-opportunities/eic-accelerator/eic-accelerator-challenges-2025/genai4eu-creating-european-champions-generative-ai_en#:~:text=increasing%20the%20security%20of%20European,to%20revolutionize%20these%20fields%20further))  ([GenAI4EU: Creating European Champions in Generative AI - European Commission](https://eic.ec.europa.eu/eic-funding-opportunities/eic-accelerator/eic-accelerator-challenges-2025/genai4eu-creating-european-champions-generative-ai_en#:~:text=In%20line%20with%20the%20AI,in%20a%20critical%20technology%20area)) 

- **Deadlines and Timeline Planning:** Keep track of **annual work programmes**. The EIC and Horizon Europe update their work programmes (with topics and deadlines) usually by end of the previous year. Digital Europe calls are announced periodically. Mark your calendar with known deadlines (like the EIC Accelerator cut-offs) and leave ample time for proposal development (several weeks to months). Late submissions are not accepted, so punctuality is key

By leveraging these funding options, an early-stage Generative AI startup in Belgium can obtain critical financial support – from **research grants and innovation subsidies** to **equity investments for scale-up** – all under the umbrella of the STEP initiative. Each program has its nuances, but together they form a robust support system for Europe’s next generation of AI innovators. For official details and application portals, refer to the links and sources provided, and consider reaching out to the relevant EU agencies for any clarifications.
