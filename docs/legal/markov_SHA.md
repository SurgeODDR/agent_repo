## 7. SHARE TRANSFERS

### 7.1 Transfer restrictions

1. No Shareholder will Transfer any Shares other than in compliance with the provisions of this Article 6. Prior to the 5th anniversary of this Agreement (the “Lock Up Period”), no Shareholder may Transfer any Shares unless the Transfer is made in accordance with Article 6.5 (Permitted Transfers), made by any Shareholder pursuant to Article 6.3 (Tag Along), to Article 6.4 (Drag Along).

2. Each of the Parties agrees that, except in case of an exit where all Shareholders Transfer their Shares, if any Person wishes to become a holder of any Shares, such Person must deliver an executed Agreement of Adherence in favour of all the other Parties. Should it be judged that such restriction on the Transfer of Shares is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties undertake to use their best efforts to cause any transferee to undertake to sign the Agreement of Adherence and to be bound by all terms of this Agreement.

### 7.2 Right of First Offer

1. If a holder of a Class of Shares (the "Transferring Shareholder") desires to Transfer all or part of its Shares (the "Offered Shares"), such Transferring Shareholder will give prior written notice (the "RoFO Notice") of such intention to the holder(s) of the other Class of Shares (the "Other Shareholder(s)") specifying the price at which it is willing to Transfer its Shares (the "RoFO Price") and any other terms and conditions of the proposed Transfer.

2. The RoFO Notice will constitute an irrevocable offer by the Transferring Shareholder to the Other Shareholder(s) to sell to such Other Shareholder(s), for the same consideration per Offered Share as the RoFO Price and on the terms and condition set forth in the RoFO Notice, the Offered Shares.

3. Each Other Shareholder will have the right, but not the obligation, exercisable within twenty (20) Business Days (the "RoFO Exercise Period") from receipt of the RoFO Notice by written notice (the "RoFO Exercise Notice") to the Transferring Shareholder to submit an offer for all (and not less than all) of the Offered Shares (the "Right of First Offer"). In case there is more than one Other Shareholder, and unless the Other Shareholders otherwise agree and notify the Transferring Shareholder of such agreement, each Other Shareholder will have the Right of First Offer on a number of Offered Shares equal to the total number of Offered Shares multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of Shares owned by such Other Shareholder and the denominator of which is the total number of Shares of the same Class of Shares as such Other Shareholder. The Right of First Offer can however only be validly exercised if it relates to all Offered Shares, whichever Other Shareholder exercises the Right of First Offer for whichever number of Offered Shares.

4. If the Other Shareholder(s) send(s) a RoFO Exercise Notice to the Transferring Shareholder within the RoFO Exercise Period, the Transferring Shareholder will then Transfer the Offered Shares to such Other Shareholder(s) against payment by such Other Shareholder(s) of the RoFO Price within ten (10) Business Days from the date of the RoFO Exercise Notice (which period may be extended, as the case may be, by such period of time as is necessary to obtain the approval of any competent competition or other regulatory authority) and taking into account the same terms and conditions as set forth in the RoFO Notice.

5. If no Other Shareholder sends a RoFO Exercise Notice to the Transferring Shareholder within the RoFO Exercise Period or the Right of First Offer is not validly exercised by the Other Shareholders, the Other Shareholder(s) will be deemed not to exercise the Right of First Offer. In such event, the Transferring Shareholder will be entitled, subject and without prejudice to the provisions of Article 7.3 below, at any time within a period of twelve (12) months after the end of the RoFO Exercise Period, to Transfer its Offered Shares to any Person at a price not lower than the RoFO Price and on other terms and conditions which are not less favourable to the Transferring Shareholder as those mentioned in the RoFO Notice. If such a Transfer has not taken place within the aforementioned twelve (12) months period, the Right of First Offer-procedure set forth in this Article 7.2 must be complied with again.

### 7.3 Right of First Refusal and Tag-Along Right

1. Before the Transferring Shareholder can however proceed with the Transfer in accordance with Article 7.2(e) above to a Person from which it has received a bona fide offer to purchase the Offered Shares (the "Prospective Transferee"), it will give prior written notice (the "RoFR / Tag Notice") to the Other Shareholder(s). Each Other Shareholder will be entitled to a right of first refusal for all (and not less than all) Offered Shares (the "Right of First Refusal") or, if the Offered Shares amount to more than fifty percent (50 %) of all Shares owned by the Transferring Shareholder and the Other Shareholder(s) do(es) not (validly) exercise the Right of First Refusal, a right to sell jointly with the Transferring Shareholder all (and not less than all) of its (their) outstanding Shares (the "Tag-Along Right"), in each case as further described in this Article 7.3. In case there is more than one Other Shareholder, and unless the Other Shareholders otherwise agree and notify the Transferring Shareholder of such agreement, each Other Shareholder will have the Right of Refusal on a number of Offered Shares equal to the total number of Offered Shares multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of Shares owned by such Other Shareholder and the denominator of which is the total number of Shares of the same Class of Shares than such Other Shareholder. The Right of First Refusal can however only be validly exercised if it relates to all Offered Shares, whichever Other Shareholder exercises the Right of First Refusal for whichever number of Offered Shares.

2. The RoFR / Tag Notice must contain the full name and address (or registered office) of the Prospective Transferee, as well as its ultimate beneficial owners, and the price per Share (the "Offered Consideration") and any other conditions offered by the Prospective Transferee (the "Offered Conditions"), as well as a copy of the bona fide offer of the Prospective Transferee to the Transferring Shareholder.

3. The RoFR / Tag Notice will constitute an irrevocable offer by the Transferring Shareholder to the Other Shareholder(s) to sell to such Other Shareholder(s), for the same consideration per Share as the Offered Consideration and subject to mutatis mutandis the same terms and conditions as the Offered Conditions, the Offered Shares.

4. Each Other Shareholder will inform the Transferring Shareholder by written notice (the "Response Notice") within twenty (20) Business Days following the date of the RoFR / Tag Notice (the "Response Deadline") either that (x) it wishes to exercise its Right of First Refusal in respect of the Offered Shares (in which case sub-paragraph 7.3(e) will apply, subject to the applicable provisions of sub-paragraph 7.3(a)) or, if the Offered Shares amount to more than fifty percent (50 %) of all Shares owned by the Transferring Shareholder, (y) it wishes to exercise its Tag-Along Right (in which case sub-paragraph 7.3(f) will apply). The election made in the Response Notice will be final and irrevocable, provided that the Transfer of the Offered Shares is completed in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Article 7.3.

5. If the Other Shareholder(s) has (have) elected, in its (their) Response Notice, to exercise its (their) Right of First Refusal, then such response will (i) constitute a final and irrevocable waiver in full by the Other Shareholder(s) of any applicable Tag-Along Right with respect to the Offered Shares, and, if the Right of First Refusal is validly exercised, (ii) constitute a binding agreement by the Other Shareholder(s) to purchase, at the Offered Consideration and subject to the Offered Conditions, the Offered Shares, and such Transfer will be completed, and the price therefor paid in full by the Other Shareholder(s), within ten (10) Business Days from the date of the Response Notice (which period may be extended, as the case may be, by such period of time as is necessary to obtain the approval of any competent competition or other regulatory authority).

6. If the Other Shareholder(s) has (have) elected, in its (their) Response Notice, to exercise its (their) Tag-Along Right (if any), the Transferring Shareholder will not effect the Transfer of the Offered Shares, unless the Prospective Transferee has first acquired from such Other Shareholder(s) all (and not less than all) of its (their) Shares at the Offered Consideration and subject to mutatis mutandis the Offered Conditions.

7. If, following the above procedure, the Other Shareholder(s) has (have) not (validly) exercised its (their) Right of First Refusal or its (their) Tag-along Right, has (have) not issued a Response Notice within the Response Deadline, or has (have) provided to the Transferring Shareholder a notice stating that it (they) does (do) not wish to exercise its (their) Right of First Refusal or its (their) Tag-along Right (if any), then the Transferring Shareholder will be entitled to complete, within a period of twenty (20) Business Days (which period may be extended, as the case may be, by such period of time as is necessary to obtain the approval of any competent competition or other regulatory authority) following the earlier of (i) the notice by the Other Shareholder(s) stating that it (they) does (do) not wish to exercise the Right of First Refusal or the Tag-along Right (if any) and (ii) the Response Deadline, the Transfer of the Offered Shares for the Offered Consideration per Share and at the Offered Conditions as set forth in the RoFR / Tag Notice. If such a completion has not taken place within the aforementioned twenty (20) Business Days period (as same may have been extended by such period of time as is necessary to obtain the approval of any competent competition or other regulatory authority), the procedure set forth in Article 7.3 must be repeated and complied with again.

### 7.4 Drag-Along Right

1. If Shareholders holding at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the Shares (the "Transferring Shareholders") wish to Transfer all of their Shares (the "Relevant Shares") under a bona fide arm's length offer (a "Drag Along Offer" at the "Drag Along Price") to one or more persons (a "Drag Along Purchaser"), then they have the option to require all of the other Shareholders ("Dragged Shareholders") to Transfer all of their Shares to the Drag Along Purchaser.

2. The Transferring Shareholders may exercise the Drag-Along Right by giving a written notice (a "Drag Along Notice") to the Dragged Shareholders specifying:  
   (i) that the Dragged Shareholders are, or will be, required to Transfer their Shares under this Article to the Drag Along Purchaser, unless the Dragged Shareholders propose another purchaser (the "Second Drag Along Purchaser") making, within eight (8) weeks after the Drag Along Notice, an unconditional offer to purchase the Relevant Shares and all of the Shares of the Dragged Shareholders at (at least) 101% of the Drag Along Price per Share (the "Second Drag Along Price") and under the same conditions as the Drag Along Offer (the "Second Drag Along Offer");  
   (ii) on or about the date specified in the Drag Along Notice;  
   (iii) or (if no date is specified), on or about any date that the Transferring Shareholders specify by notice in writing, which in either case shall not be less than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of the Drag Along Notice; and  
   (iv) the estimated Drag Along Price (or the means by which the Drag Along Price will be calculated), which shall be not less than the price per Share offered or proposed to be offered to the Transferring Shareholders under the Drag Along Offer.

3. If the Second Drag Along Purchaser does not pay the Second Drag Along Price per Share for the Relevant Shares and all of the Shares of the Dragged Shareholders, to the Transferring Shareholders and the Dragged Shareholders, within one (1) week after the Second Drag Along Offer, the Second Drag Along Offer will be deemed to be invalid or revoked, in which case all of the Shares of the Dragged Shareholders will be deemed to have been Transferred to the Drag Along Purchaser at the Drag Along Price per Share offered or proposed to be offered to the Transferring Shareholders under the Drag Along Offer.

4. Nothing in this paragraph obliges the Transferring Shareholders or a Dragged Shareholder when transferring Shares under this Article to comply with Article 7.3 (Tag Along).

5. For the avoidance of doubt:  
   (i) the Transferring Shareholders may serve a Drag Along Notice more than once; and  
   (ii) a Drag Along Notice may be revoked at any time by the Transferring Shareholders giving written notice to the Company before the proposed Transfer of Shares to the Drag Along Purchaser becomes wholly unconditional.

### 7.5 Permitted Transfers

The Parties agree that the following Transfers will not be subject to any of the Transfer restrictions provided for in Articles 7.2 or 7.3 (but, for the avoidance of doubt, will still be subject to the provisions of Article 7.1):

1. a Transfer of Shares by a Shareholder for estate planning or tax planning purposes to a legal entity which is Controlled by the Existing Shareholder, provided that the Shareholder undertakes to procure that, in the event such legal entity would cease to be Controlled by the Existing Shareholder, such legal entity will re-Transfer prior to ceasing to be so Controlled the relevant Shares held by it to the initial Transferring Shareholder or any other legal entity which is Controlled by the Existing Shareholder;

2. a Transfer of Shares by a Shareholder resulting from the exercise of a Good Leaver Option or a Bad Leaver Option.

### 7.7 Cooperation and assistance

### 7.8 Change in control of a shareholding company

If a Shareholder is a company, any change in control of this shareholding company will be deemed to be a Transfer of the Shares held by this shareholding company, and the shareholding company will in such case comply with the articles related to Share Transfers and Transfer restrictions as if the Shares would be transferred to a third party.

### 7.9 Bad Leaver Call Option

The Company has the right to purchase all shares held by a Shareholder (the “Bad Leaver”), and this Bad Leaver is obliged to sell all of his shares to the Company at the Bad Leaver Price, in one or more of the following situations (the “Bad Leaver Situations”), by giving notice to the Bad Leaver of the Company's intention to purchase the shares (the “Bad Leaver Call Option Notice”):

1. If the Bad Leaver’s employment or service agreement is terminated by the Company (or an affiliate of the Company) for Cause;

2. If the Bad Leaver’s employment or service agreement is terminated by the Bad Leaver without the consent of the Company (or an affiliate of the Company) and without Good Reason on or prior to the third anniversary of this Agreement; or

3. If the Bad Leaver materially breaches any of the covenants included in this Agreement or in his employment or service agreement and does not cure such breach within fifteen (15) days of written notice from the Company (or an affiliate of the Company) or the Company (or an affiliate of the Company) becomes aware of the Bad Leaver’s willful breach of any of the aforementioned covenants.

The shares will be transferred to the Company on the date of the Bad Leaver Call Option Notice.

The Company has the right to purchase all shares held by a Shareholder (the “Good Leaver”), and this Good Leaver is obliged to sell all of his shares to the Company at the Good Leaver Price, in one or more of the following situations (the “Good Leaver Situations”), by giving notice to the Good Leaver of the Company's intention to purchase the shares (the “Good Leaver Call Option Notice”):

1. If the Good Leaver’s employment or service agreement is terminated by the Company (or an affiliate of the Company) without Cause;

2. If the Good Leaver’s employment or service agreement is terminated by the Good Leaver with the consent of the Company (or an affiliate of the Company) or with Good Reason on or prior to the third anniversary of this Agreement or without Good Reason after the third anniversary of this Agreement; or

3. In case of death, permanent disability or retirement of the Good Leaver.

The shares will be transferred to the Company on the date of the Good Leaver Call Option Notice.  
The Good Leaver Price will be paid to the Good Leaver amortized over eight (8) quarterly payments following the date of the Good Leaver Call Option Notice. If during this payment period the Good Leaver is employed by a competitor of the Company or if any other Bad Leaver Situations would apply, the Good Leaver Price will not be due any more, and the Bad Leaver Price will apply.

### 7.11 Dilution Protection

1. In the event the Company proposes to issue additional shares ("New Shares"), each existing Shareholder ("Existing Shareholder") shall be granted the right, but not the obligation, to subscribe for New Shares on a pro rata basis to maintain their existing ownership percentage in the Company ("Dilution Protection Right").

2. The Company shall provide written notice ("Dilution Notice") to all Existing Shareholders at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the planned issuance of any New Shares.

3. Each Existing Shareholder shall have the right to exercise their Dilution Protection Right within ten (10) Business Days from receipt of the Dilution Notice by providing written notice ("Exercise Notice") to the Company. Failure to submit an Exercise Notice within the specified timeframe shall be deemed a waiver of the Dilution Protection Right for that specific issuance of New Shares.

4. If the Dilution Protection Right is not exercised by an Existing Shareholder within the specified timeframe or is otherwise waived, the Company shall be free to issue the New Shares to third parties in accordance with the Issuance Terms, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

5. *(Reserved for further clauses if needed.)*
